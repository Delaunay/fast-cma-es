== Vehicle Routing

This tutorial

- Is related to https://github.com/krishna-praveen/Capacitated-Vehicle-Routing-Problem[Vehicle Routing]
- Shows an alternative implementation using https://numba.pydata.org/[numba].
- Compares different optimization algorithms applied to this problem.
- Extends the problem by adding a second objective: The maximal vehicle capacity. 

All results were produced using a 16 core / 32 thread AMD CPU 5950x. The code for this tutorial is
here: https://github.com/dietmarwo/fast-cma-es/blob/master/examples/routing.py[routing.py]

=== Problem Statement

The original problem statement from
https://github.com/krishna-praveen/Capacitated-Vehicle-Routing-Problem[Vehicle Routing]:

"Delivery companies every day need to deliver packages to many different clients. 
The deliveries are accomplished using an available fleet of vehicles from a central warehouse. 
The goal of this exercise is to design a route for each vehicle so that all customers are served, 
and the number of vehicles (objective 1) along with the total traveled distance (objective 2) 
by all the vehicles are minimized. In addition, the capacity of each vehicle should not be exceeded (constraint 1)"
Due date, service time and ready time are ignored.

Since minimizing the vehicle number and the total travel distance are non-competing objectives, 
the pareto-front always contains a single element. Therefore we

- Solve the single-objective variant independent of the vehicle number. 
- Define a 2-objective variant maximizing the vehicle number (works, but makes not much sense).
- Define a useful 2-objective variant optimizing total travel distance and vehicle capacity. 

=== Motivation

https://github.com/krishna-praveen/Capacitated-Vehicle-Routing-Problem[Vehicle Routing] implements
the vehicle routing problem by defining a specific individual encoding / decoding together
with specific mutation and crossover operations. This approach has several drawbacks:

- All the customized code needs to be adapted if the problem is varied or extended, for instance
considering due date, service time and ready time. If we can reduce the problem specific code, adaption
is much easier. 
- Defining additional / alternative objectives is difficult.
- Low performance of the fitness function evaluation. 
- No automated parallelization. 
 
If you execute the given code 
https://github.com/krishna-praveen/Capacitated-Vehicle-Routing-Problem/blob/master/runAlgo.py[runAlgo.py]
using the given parameterization you don't find good results for the predefined vehicle
capacity=70. So I redefined numGen = 20000 (default is 200) and ran the code manually 16 times in parallel
to utilize the CPU cores. After a few minutes I got:

----

The standard deviation of the results was high, I got several results > 400. This means:

- Even with 20000 generations you have to be lucky.
- Parallelization is manual and you have to check all the results to find a good one. 
- But at least I found a good result this way. 

Lets see if we can do better than this.

=== Fast Fitness Function

First we have to define a fast fitness function using https://numba.pydata.org/[numba] enabling 
- in combination with parallelization - an evaluation rate > 1E6 / second. This will enable single objective
optimization in less than 2 seconds, and multi-objective optimization in less than a minute. 

[source,python]
---- 
@njit(fastmath=True)
def fitness_(seq, distance, demands, capacity):
    n = len(seq)
    seq += 1
    sum_demand = 0
    sum_dist = 0
    last = 0
    vehicles = 1
    for i in range(n+1):
        customer = seq[i] if i < n else 0
        demand = demands[customer]
        if sum_demand + demand > capacity:
            # end vehicle tour, return to base
            sum_dist += distance[last, 0]
            sum_demand = 0
            vehicles += 1
            last = 0
        # go to customer
        sum_demand += demand
        sum_dist += distance[last, customer]
        last = customer
    return np.array([-float(vehicles), sum_dist])
---- 

We use a very similar encoding as 
https://github.com/krishna-praveen/Capacitated-Vehicle-Routing-Problem[Vehicle Routing], which means we have a 
sequence of unique integer vehicle indices as input and determine the vehicle tours "on the fly" when we
detect that the vehicle capacity is exceeded. But up to now we don't need classes - as this is easier with numba.
And we leave all the optimization related stuff to predefined algorithms from the fcmaes library. 
There is no need to define problem specific mutation and crossover operations. 

We define a Routing class hosting both the multi-objective and the single objective variant of the
fitness function, together with the demands array and the distance matrix. As boundaries we use
the [0,1] interval and the `np.argsort(x)` trick to convert the continuous argument vector `x` into a
sequence of unique integer indices. This way we can apply regular continuous optimization algorithms. 

[source,python]
---- 
class Routing():
    def __init__(self, filename, capacity):
        self.capacity = capacity
        self.demands, self.distance = parse(filename)
        self.dim = len(self.demands) - 1
        self.bounds = Bounds([0]*self.dim, [1]*self.dim)

    def fitness(self, x):  # returns number of vehicles and cost 
        return fitness_(np.argsort(x), self.distance, self.demands, self.capacity)

    def fitness_so(self, x): # returns the cost only
        return fitness_(np.argsort(x), self.distance, self.demands, self.capacity)[1]
---- 


This is so much easier than to define problem specific crossover / mutation operations someone might
ask the question: How is it possible this is even suggested? First there is the pedagogical aspect:
You get involved in the "inner workings" of the optimization process. Second, the power of continuous 
optimization for discrete problems is widely underestimated. There are not many open source libraries supporting
fast implementations of state of the art algorithms utilizing parallelization in a way which achieves
high scalability with the number of CPU-cores.  

But for bigger instances / more complex problem variants you definitely should switch to a faster
implementation of the fitness function and an optimizer utilizing all your CPU-cores.

=== Single-Objective Optimization

We use a standard wrapper around the single objective fitness function to monitor the progress
of the parallel optimization and use the `minimize_plot` function which not only optimizes, but
also produces a plot of the progress over time. 
 
[source,python]
---- 
def optimize_so(filename, capacity, opt, num_retries = 320):
    routing = Routing(filename, capacity)
    name = "routing." + str(opt.max_evaluations)    
    ret = retry.minimize_plot(name, opt, wrapper(routing.fitness_so), 
                               routing.bounds, num_retries = num_retries, logger=logger())
    routing.dump(np.argsort(ret.x), ret.fun)

capacity = 70
popsize = 128
max_evaluations = 100000
    
optimize_so(filename, capacity, Bite_cpp(max_evaluations))
#optimize_so(filename, capacity, Crfmnes_cpp(max_evaluations,popsize=popsize))
#optimize_so(filename, capacity, de_cma(max_evaluations,popsize=popsize))
#optimize_so(filename, capacity, De_cpp(max_evaluations,popsize=popsize))
----

We propose four different single objective algorithms, where BiteOpt is the
best choice here: You don't have to tweak the algorithm, it 
supports "auto-configuration". But all three other choices will also produce good results
very fast. 

Even when coding your problem specific operations (crossover and mutation) in Assembler, 
it won't be easy to beat this result with `capacity=70`:

=== Multi-Objective Optimization

Minimizing the number of vehicles is a non-competing goal, so it makes more
sense to check the result for different vehicle capacity settings. 
We add a new input variable defining the capacity of all vehicles, define its
boundaries [40, 500] and return it as objective together with the cost. 

[source,python]
---- 
class Routing():
    def __init__(self, filename, capacity):
        ..
        self.bounds_capacity = Bounds([40] + [0]*(self.dim), [500] + [1]*self.dim)

    def fitness_capacity(self, x):   
        y = fitness_(np.argsort(x[1:]), self.distance, self.demands, x[0])
        return np.array([x[0], y[1]])
        
def optimize_capacity(filename, popsize, max_evaluations, num_retries = 640):
    routing = Routing(filename, 0)    
    x, y = modecpp.retry(mode.wrapper(routing.fitness_capacity, 2, interval = 10000000), 2, 0,
                 routing.bounds_capacity, popsize = popsize, 
                 max_evaluations = max_evaluations, 
                 nsga_update=True, num_retries = num_retries)
    pname = "routing." + str(popsize) + "." + str(max_evaluations)
    np.savez_compressed(pname, xs=x, ys=y)
    moretry.plot(pname, 0, x, y, all=False, interp=True)#, plot3d=True)
    routing.dump(np.argsort(x[-1][1:]), y[-1], y[-1][0])
---- 

The pareto front shows that we could save some cost by increasing the vehicle capacity.

==== Conclusion

A continuous optimizer can solve both the single- and multi-objective vehicle routing problem in a few seconds. 
Both coding and adaption to more complex problem variants is much easier than with problem specific crossover / mutation
operations.
