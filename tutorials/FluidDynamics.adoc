= Solving the ESP2, ESP3 and PitzDaily Fluid Dynamics Benchmark Problems

This tutorial

- Shows how to solve the 
https://github.com/AlgTUDelft/ExpensiveOptimBenchmark/blob/master/expensiveoptimbenchmark/problems/DockerCFDBenchmark.py[ESP and PitzDaily]
real world problems using fcmaes differential evolution.
- Compares with a surrogate model based solver https://github.com/AlgTUDelft/ExpensiveOptimBenchmark/tree/master/expensiveoptimbenchmark/solvers/MVRSM[MVRSM].

=== Motivation

From https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.08817[Black-box Combinatorial Optimization using Models with Integer-valued Minima]:

"When a black-box optimization objective can only be evaluated with costly or noisy measurements, most standard optimization algorithms are unsuited to find the optimal solution. Specialized algorithms that deal with exactly this situation make use of surrogate models."

https://github.com/AlgTUDelft/ExpensiveOptimBenchmark/blob/master/expensiveoptimbenchmark/problems/DockerCFDBenchmark.py[ESP2]
definitely is such a problem. The question is: Do surrogate model based solvers clearly have an advantage?

Executing the objective function:

- Loads a docker image containing the open source fluid dynamic software https://www.openfoam.com/[OpenFOAM] 
- Simulates an electrostatic precipitator configured using the argument vector of the objective function
- ESP2 uses both 49 continuous and 49 discrete variables. 

An  https://algtudelft.github.io/ExpensiveOptimBenchmark/problems.html[electrostatic precipitator] is a large gas filtering installation, whose efficiency is dependent on how well the intake gas is distributed. This installation has slots which can be of various types, each having a different impact on the distribution. The goal is to find a configuration that has the best resulting distribution. 

=== How to apply fcmaes-DE

https://github.com/dietmarwo/fast-cma-es/blob/master/fcmaes/de.py[fcmaes-DE] has some advantages when applied to extremely expensive
optimization problems: 

- It converges fast because it is based on the DE/best/1 strategy
- It enables parallel function evaluation

First experiments applying fcmaes-DE to ESP2 (and ESP) were disappointing. For scheduling / route finding problems 
like job shop, GTOC11 or noisy TSP we successfully used the np.argmin / sorting trick converting continuous input variables
into a list of unique integer values. But what if the discrete values don't have to be unique like in ESP2? Here we have the additional
problem that the range for the discrete variables is very small: `[0,3]`.   

Finally I had to accept that fcmaes needed a mixed-integer upgrade which was implemented for fcmaes-DE, fcmaes-MODE (the 
new multi-objective / constraint algorithm) both for their Python and {cpp} variants. 

We now can tell the algo via a new parameter `ints` which are your discrete integer variables.
 `ints = [True, True, False]` for instance means that the first two variables are discrete.

[source,python]
---- 
from scipy.optimize import Bounds
from fcmaes import decpp, de

problem = ESP2

ret = decpp.minimize(problem.evaluate, 
            dim = problem.dims(),
            bounds = Bounds(problem.lbs(),problem.ubs()), 
            popsize = 31, 
            max_evaluations = 10000, 
            workers = 12,
            ints = [v != 'cont' for v in problem.vartype()]
            )
            
print(ret.x, ret.fun)
----

For logging purposes you could wrap `problem.evaluate`. Just be careful to use `mp.RawValue` parameters to 
monitor progress like: 

[source,python]
---- 
        self.evals = mp.RawValue(ct.c_long, 0)  # writable across python processes
        self.best_y = mp.RawValue(ct.c_double, math.inf) # writable across python processes
----

since the objective function is called in parallel. On Windows you should replace the `decpp.minimize` by 
`de.minimize`, the Python variant. Parallel retry works on Windows, parallel function evaluation has issues. 

On an AMD 5950x 16-core processor we get about 0.7 ESP2 function evaluations per second. Docker calls 
scale not optimally, but we get a decent performance gain. 

Lowerering `popsize` to 16 or 8 will speed up convergence but greatly increases the chance getting stuck in a local
minimum.

The 8 MVRSM runs were performed in parallel on a 16 core machine, the 
DE runs use parallel function evaluation. MVRSM either needs "luck" or you can 
view the parallel execution of 8 runs as a kind of "poor mans parallelization" where you are only interested
in the best out of these 8 runs. For a fair comparison only the best MVRSM run should be considered. 

There is not enough data to identify a "winner" here: Both approaches reach excellent results - which 
all other optimization methods tested did not - including fcmaes-DE without mixed integer enhancement. 

But it is obvious that any claim about the superiority of surrogate based methods is not justified considering
these results. 

=== How is mixed integer support implemented

There is nothing magic behind the mixed integer support, it is a minor - but quite effective - modification:
The first change is related to the bounds: Since the algorithm internally works with continuous variables
(floats) we should assign the same value range to each discrete choice inside the bounds. This range has
the size 1.0, so we have to adapt the lower and upper bounds, which are expected to be given as integer
values:

[source,python]
----
    if modifier is None and not ints is None:
        # adjust bounds because ints are rounded
        self.lower[ints] -= .499999999
        self.upper[ints] += .499999999
        self.modifier = self._modifier
----

The second modification is related to the generation of new argument vectors by mutation / crossover. 

- Generated values are rounded to the next integer value: `x[self.ints] = np.around(x_ints,0)`. 

This is because candidates are produced based on differences (this is why it is called "Differential" Evolution). 
We want this differences being discrete values. 

- We add some random mutations on the integer variables, with random probability dependent on
the number of integer variables. 

This is because I observed stagnation related to the integer variables in the later stages of the optimization
process. Checking the https://github.com/AlgTUDelft/ExpensiveOptimBenchmark/tree/master/expensiveoptimbenchmark/solvers/MVRSM[MVRSM]
code I noticed there are plenty of mutations for the discrete variables, so I thought may be doing something similar
could help. Using the Python variants of the algorithms you can define your own sample `modifier` overwriting the default behavior. 
Please notice me when you found an improvement. 

[source,python]
----
    # default modifier for integer variables
    def _modifier(self, x):
        x_ints = x[self.ints]
        n_ints = len(self.ints)
        lb = self.lower[self.ints]
        ub = self.upper[self.ints]
        min_mutate = 0.5
        max_mutate = max(1.0, n_ints/20.0)
        to_mutate = self.rg.uniform(min_mutate, max_mutate)
        # mututate some integer variables
        x_ints = np.array([x if self.rg.random() > to_mutate/n_ints else 
                           self.rg.uniform(lb[i], ub[i])
                           for i, x in enumerate(x_ints)])
        # round to int values
        x[self.ints] = np.around(x_ints,0)
        return x   
----

=== ESP3

https://github.com/AlgTUDelft/ExpensiveOptimBenchmark/blob/master/expensiveoptimbenchmark/problems/DockerCFDBenchmark.py[ESP3]
is another mixed integer modification of the ESP CFD problem with less continuous variables.  

[source,python]
---- 
from scipy.optimize import Bounds
from fcmaes import decpp, de

problem = ESP3

ret = decpp.minimize(problem.evaluate, 
            dim = problem.dims(),
            bounds = Bounds(problem.lbs(),problem.ubs()), 
            popsize = 24, 
            max_evaluations = 5000, 
            workers = 12,
            ints = [v != 'cont' for v in problem.vartype()]
            )
            
print(ret.x, ret.fun)
----

`popsize` can be reduced to 24 for this problem. Parallel execution on an AMD 5950x CPU enabled an execution time
of about `1.5` sec / evaluation.

In https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3449726.3463136[Bliek21] 
you may find results for surrogate based optimizers for this problem.

=== PitzDaily

PitzDaily is another benchmark included in https://github.com/AlgTUDelft/ExpensiveOptimBenchmark/blob/master/expensiveoptimbenchmark/problems/DockerCFDBenchmark.py[ESP and PitzDaily]. The problem assesses the effect of combustion on the
mean flowfield properties such as mixing layer growth, entrainment rate, and reattachment length. 
Here https://www.thevisualroom.com/33_machine_learning/optimiserTestProblemSuite/PitzDailyAlma.html[PitzDaily] is a nice visualization of the problem. It was chosen as an https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6U8fdNqsec[OpenFOAM] tutorial, because
it has limited complexity: Only continuous variables and low dimension = 10. fcmaes-DE can solve it easily.  

[source,python]
---- 
from scipy.optimize import Bounds
from fcmaes import decpp, de

problem = PitzDaily

ret = decpp.minimize(problem.evaluate, 
            dim = problem.dims(),
            bounds = Bounds(problem.lbs(),problem.ubs()), 
            popsize = 24, 
            max_evaluations = 5000, 
            workers = 12,
            )
            
print(ret.x, ret.fun)
----

`popsize` can be reduced to 24 for this problem, no `ints` parameter is required, since all variables are continuous. 

image::DE_PitzDaily_CFD_problem.png[]

After about 600 seconds all but one out of 13 runs reach 0.08. And this last one also succeeds after about 1100 seconds.  
What is a bit surprising is that solutions < 0.079 are hard to find in the literature. 
Parallel execution on an AMD 5950x CPU enabled an execution time
of about `0.7` sec / evaluation. 

==== Conclusion

To summarize: 

- We couldn't confirm the superiority of surrogate based methods for for complex mixed integer CFD 
simulation based methods as suggested by some publications. 
- fcmaes Differential Evolution, thanks to its mixed integer support is a serious competition - already
equipped with the ability to perform parallel function evaluations which is very helpful with costly CDF simulations. 
- The fcmaes multi objective solver (MO-DE) with mixed integer support is ready to be tested in this application area.
