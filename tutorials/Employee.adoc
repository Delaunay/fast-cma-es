= Employee Scheduling

This tutorial:

- Is based on 
https://github.com/optapy/optapy-quickstarts/blob/stable/employee-scheduling/README.adoc[employee-scheduling],
an https://github.com/optapy/optapy[OptaPy] tutorial for employee scheduling.
- Will show how to improve the OptaPy result by applying parallel continuous optimization.
- Illustrate how easy it is to specify the corresponding fitness function.
- Apply multi-objective optimization to produce a set of non-dominated scheduling choices which 
involve an additional competing objective.

The code for this tutorial is
here: 

- https://github.com/dietmarwo/fast-cma-es/blob/master/examples/employee.py[employee.py].

== Motivation

Employee scheduling is a very common scheduling optimization problem. There are hard constraints
- like an employees skills don't fit the requirements for a specific slot,  or she is unavailable at a certain day - 
and soft constraints - like an employee prefers to work at a specific shift. These constraints 
have to be correctly prioritized. 

Applying continuous optimization is not very common here, but recent developments have largely increased its applicability. 
The main reasons are:

- Using https://numba.pydata.org/[numba] and parallel execution on a modern many-core CPU you can execute up to 
1000.000 evaluations/sec of a fitness function evaluating a possible schedule. 
- Modern continuous optimization algorithms like https://github.com/avaneev/biteopt[BiteOpt] can handle discrete problems very well. 

So even if millions of fitness evaluations are required to solve a scheduling/planning problem, this is a matter
of seconds now. 

But this is only half of the story: What if you want to consider an additional competing objective and want to 
generate a number of non-dominating choices - a so called pareto-front? For continuous optimization this is a
"solved problem", you get it "for free", but not for traditional scheduling optimizers like https://github.com/optapy/optapy[OptaPy].

Now you could argue, that it is easier to specify the details of a scheduling problem using an API specifically created
for these kind of problems. An answer to this argument involves the presentation of an alternative: The creation
of a fitness function solving the problem and let the reader decide what is easier. 

=== Employee Scheduling using OptaPy

We recommend that you try out the original example 
https://github.com/optapy/optapy-quickstarts/blob/stable/employee-scheduling/README.adoc[employee-scheduling]
first. The concrete instance is generated randomly but you will see a generated schedule similar to this one:

image::schedule1.png[]

If you switch to the employee view:

image::employee1.png[]

you will notice two things:

- Some employees are almost doing nothing.
- The green slots are almost empty. This means the "desires" of the employees to work at a specific day are almost ignored. 

If you interpret the "DESIRED" fields as days an employee wants to work and use the start of a shift to 
identify the day, then no "desires" are fulfilled. 

We get:

----
desired shift days 0
shifts per employee [11, 13, 13, 13, 12, 14, 11, 12, 7, 4, 8, 5, 1, 0, 0, 2]
min shifts per employee 0
mean shifts per employee 7.875
std shifts per employee 4.998437255783052
----

What happens of we repeat the experiment? We always end up with the same result, so we have no alternatives we can 
choose from. 

Imagine what would happen if you would install such a schedule in the real world. You would soon end up with less employees, since
some would prefer to work elsewhere. Hiring people is expensive, so lets see if we can do something about that. 

=== Generating a Test Problem

We used the following code to generate the JSON-representation of an employee 
scheduling problem using https://github.com/optapy/optapy[OptaPy]. 

[source,python]
----
def save_solution():
    global schedule
    generate_demo_data()
    solve()
    while get_solver_status() != SolverStatus.NOT_SOLVING:
        time.sleep(5)
        print(get_solver_status())  
    solver_status = get_solver_status()
    solution = schedule
    score = score_manager.updateScore(solution)
    solution.solver_status = solver_status
    solution.score = score
    sched = solution.to_dict()
    sched_json = json.dumps(sched)
    print(sched_json)
    with open('sched.json', 'w') as outfile:
        outfile.write(sched_json)
----

Note that this JSON includes already an OptaPy solution - which we will ignore - but we didn't 
find a way to export the problem without solving it first. 

Our code in https://github.com/dietmarwo/fast-cma-es/blob/master/examples/employee.py[employee.py]
is completely independent from OctaPy and the example code in 
https://github.com/optapy/optapy-quickstarts/blob/stable/employee-scheduling/README.adoc[employee-scheduling],
it only depends on the generated problem instance. 

=== Representing the Employee Scheduling JSON instance as Optimization Problem  

We now can read all the solution-independent parts of the generated JSON to produce
a continuous optimization problem including a fitness function:

[source,python]
----
class problem():
    
    def __init__(self, json_file):
        with open(json_file) as json_file:
            sched = json.load(json_file)    
            
        self.shifts = sched['shift_list']
        self.shift_to_index, self.days, self.locations, self.required_skills, \
                self.sec_start, self.sec_end = shift_indices(self.shifts)
        self.day_to_index, self.day_ids = index_map(self.days)
        self.location_to_index, self.location_ids = index_map(self.locations)
                
        self.employees = sched['employee_list']
        self.employee_to_index, self.names, self.skill_sets = employee_indices(self.employees)
        self.name_to_index, self.name_ids = index_map(self.names)
        self.skill_to_index, self.skill_set_ids = index_multi_map(self.skill_sets)
        self.required_skill_ids = np.array([self.skill_to_index[s] for s in self.required_skills])

        self.avails = sched['availability_list']
        self.avail_to_index, self.avail_names, self.avail_types, self.avail_days = avail_indices(self.avails)
        self.avail_name_ids = np.array([self.name_to_index[n] for n in self.avail_names])
        self.avail_day_ids = np.array([self.day_to_index[d] for d in self.avail_days])
        self.avail_type_ids = np.array([avail_type_map[t] for t in self.avail_types])
        
        self.dim = len(self.shifts)
        self.bounds = Bounds([0]*self.dim, [len(self.employees)-1E-9]*self.dim)  

    def fitness(self, x):
        score, employee_num_shifts = fitness_(x.astype(int), self.day_ids, 
                    self.required_skill_ids, self.skill_set_ids, self.avail_name_ids, 
                    self.avail_day_ids, self.avail_type_ids, self.sec_start, self.sec_end)
        return score - 0.1*min(employee_num_shifts)
----

Note that we convert all the information into numpy-index-arrays, together
with lists which allow to retrieve the original representation from these indices. 

The numpy-index-array representation helps to speed up the fitness evaluation 
by using https://numba.pydata.org/[numba]. numba loves numpy arrays - and hates objects -  
and the indices accelerate the comparisons.

The fitness function forwards these index-arrays to a fast numba function 
`fitness_(x.astype(int), ...` discussed below. Note that the continuous decision vector
`x` is converted into discrete integer values using `x.astype(int)`.

=== Implementing the Fitness Function

The fitness function needs to check how many hard and soft constraints 
an employee schedule `employees_at_shift` given as decision vector violates.   
We multiply hard constraints by factor 1000 to priorize them. `UNDESIRED`
constraints - that an employee prefers not to work at a specific day - 
will get factor 100, and `DESIRED` constraints 
- that an employee likes to work at a specific day - gets a negative  
factor `-1`, because we want to maximize its fulfillment.  

[source,python]

@njit(fastmath=True)
def fitness_(employees_at_shift, day_ids, required_skill_ids, skill_set_ids, 
             avail_names_ids, avail_days_ids, avail_type_ids, sec_start, sec_end):
    score = 0
    num_employees = len(skill_set_ids)
    employee_last_day = np.full(num_employees, -1, dtype=numba.int32)
    employee_last_end = np.full(num_employees, -1, dtype=numba.int32)
    employee_num_shifts = np.zeros(num_employees, dtype=numba.int32)
    for shift in range(len(employees_at_shift)):
        day = day_ids[shift]
        employee = employees_at_shift[shift]
        employee_num_shifts[employee] += 1
        if employee_last_day[employee] == day:
            score += 1000  # employee should only work once a day
            continue
        employee_last_day[employee] = day
        if sec_start[shift] - employee_last_end[employee] < 10*3600:
            score += 1000  # employee should pause for 10 hours (and shifts should not overlap)
            continue
        employee_last_end[employee] = sec_end[shift]
        required_skill = required_skill_ids[shift]
        skill_set = skill_set_ids[employee]
        if not required_skill in skill_set: 
            score += 1000 # employee has wrong skill set
        avail_ids = np.where(avail_names_ids == employee)
        for avail_id in avail_ids[0]:
            avail_day = avail_days_ids[avail_id]
            if day == avail_day:
                type = avail_type_ids[avail_id]
                if type == UNDESIRED:  
                    score += 100 # employee does not want to work this day
                elif type == UNAVAILABLE:
                    score += 1000 # employee is unavailable
                elif type == DESIRED:
                    score -= 1 # employee works at desired day
    return score, employee_num_shifts
----

You may compare the complexity of this code to
https://github.com/optapy/optapy-quickstarts/blob/stable/employee-scheduling/constraints.py[constraints.py] and
https://github.com/optapy/optapy-quickstarts/blob/stable/employee-scheduling/domain.py[domain.py].
Note that the fitness function above doesn't require any specific domain objects and
"schedule solver"-API, but still is quite readable. And it does something more:
It counts the number of shifts for each employee and returns this as an array. You may use
`np.std(employee_num_shifts)` or `-min(employee_num_shifts)` to support a more 
equal distribution of work. This way we make sure that all employees get a fair amount of work-shifts. 

=== Single Objective Optimization

We call `fcmaes.retry.minimize_plot` because we want to monitor/plot the progress over time. 
It takes an continuous optimizer as an argument. We recommend to try BiteOpt first - not only for
this problem - because it doesn't require specific parameters, it is mostly self adapting. 
`fcmaes.retry` will as default use `mp.cpu_count()` parallel workers. In our case (AMD 16 core 5950x)
this results to 32 optimizations performed in parallel. 

[source,python]
----
    def fitness(self, x):
        score, employee_num_shifts = fitness_(x.astype(int), self.day_ids, 
                    self.required_skill_ids, self.skill_set_ids, self.avail_name_ids, 
                    self.avail_day_ids, self.avail_type_ids, self.sec_start, self.sec_end)
        return score - 0.1*min(employee_num_shifts)

    def optimize(self):
        self.fitness(np.random.uniform(0, len(self.employees), self.dim).astype(int))
        res = retry.minimize_plot("schedule.bite.400k", Bite_cpp(400000),  
        #res = retry.minimize_plot("schedule.de.400k", De_cpp(400000, popsize = 512, ints = [True]*self.dim), 
                    wrapper(self.fitness), self.bounds, num_retries=32, plot_limit=10000)
        print(self.fitness_mo(res.x)) 
        self.show(res.x)
----

In the diagrams below you see:

- Both BitOpt and Differential Evolution can solve this problem.
- Less than three seconds is required to find the solution - although the optimizer runs a bit longer. 

image::employeeres.png[]

'self.show(res.x)` shows the result as a human readable list. It converts the indices back into schedules, employees and
fulfilled/violated constraints. As we see all 5 "desired" work day constraints are fulfilled and all employees get at least
5 shifts applied.  

----
desired shift days 5
shifts per employee [5, 7, 7, 9, 9, 9, 10, 9, 7, 5, 9, 9, 7, 9, 5, 10]
min shifts per employee 5
mean shifts per employee 7.875
std shifts per employee 1.6909686573085854
----

What happens if we repeat the BiteOpt optimization? We get:

----
shifts per employee [5, 10, 9, 7, 10, 10, 9, 10, 6, 5, 8, 8, 5, 9, 5, 10]
min shifts per employee 5
mean shifts per employee 7.875
std shifts per employee 1.996089927833914

desired shift days 5
shifts per employee [5, 8, 8, 7, 10, 6, 10, 10, 8, 5, 7, 11, 8, 7, 5, 11]
min shifts per employee 5
mean shifts per employee 7.875
std shifts per employee 1.996089927833914

desired shift days 5
shifts per employee [4, 7, 10, 8, 9, 7, 9, 12, 10, 4, 10, 9, 6, 8, 5, 8]
min shifts per employee 4
mean shifts per employee 7.875
std shifts per employee 2.2043990110685496

desired shift days 5
shifts per employee [5, 7, 9, 8, 9, 9, 10, 9, 8, 7, 8, 9, 5, 7, 6, 10]
min shifts per employee 5
mean shifts per employee 7.875
std shifts per employee 1.5360257159305635
...
----

We get different results we can choose from. This process obviously can be 
parallelized on different cloud CPU nodes. The last one has a quite equal work distribution
and fulfills 5 work day "desires".


=== Multi-Objective Fitness

For the fitness function the only change is that instead of adding `-0.1*np.std(employee_num_shifts)` to the first objective, 
we return a second one `np.std(employee_num_shifts)`. Note that alternatively we could maximize
the minimal number of assigned shifts to an employee: `-min(employee_num_shifts)`. 

[source,python]
----
    def fitness_mo(self, x):
        score, employee_num_shifts = fitness_(x.astype(int), self.day_ids, 
                    self.required_skill_ids, self.skill_set_ids, self.avail_name_ids, 
                    self.avail_day_ids, self.avail_type_ids, self.sec_start, self.sec_end)
        return [score, np.std(employee_num_shifts)]
        #return [score, -min(employee_num_shifts)]
----

=== Multi-Objective Optimization

Since the `fcmaes` library offers only one multi-objective optimizer "MODE", the only 
choice we have to make is whether to use differential evolution or NSGA-II population
update (parameter `nsga_update=True`). The recommendation is to try both. For this problem
NSGA-II population update works better. Multi-objective optimization usually needs
a larger population size, we choose 512 here. 

[source,python]
----
    def optimize_mo(self):
        self.fitness_mo(np.random.uniform(0, len(self.employees), self.dim).astype(int))
        pname = "schedule_mo_600k.512"    
        xs, ys = modecpp.retry(mode.wrapper(self.fitness_mo, 2), 
                     2, 0, self.bounds, popsize = 512, max_evaluations = 600000, 
                     nsga_update=True, num_retries = 32, workers=32)
        np.savez_compressed(pname, xs=xs, ys=ys)
        xs, ys = moretry.pareto(xs, ys)
        for x, y in zip(xs, ys):
            print(str(list(y)) + ' ' + str([int(xi) for xi in x]))
----

As a result, after about 36 seconds,  we get lists of corresponding argument vectors (`xs`) and function values (`ys`) which represent
the set of non-dominated solutions - the pareto-front:

----

We can use `problem.show` to check the details:

mean shifts per employee 7.875
std shifts per employee 0.6959705453537527

desired shift days 4
shifts per employee [7, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 7, 7, 9]
min shifts per employee 7
mean shifts per employee 7.875

{'name': 'Elsa Li', 'skill_set': ['Doctor']} {'employee': {'name': 'Elsa Li', 'skill_set': ['Doctor']}, 'date': '2022-07-05', 'availability_type': 'UNDESIRED'}

min shifts per employee 7
mean shifts per employee 7.875
std shifts per employee 0.33071891388307384
----

In the last solution 'Elsa Li' has to work on an undesired day, and we have only 4 'DESIRED' requirements fulfilled,
but now the shift per employee distribution is almost equal. 
Multi-objective optimization helped to produce solutions which are better at work distribution without 
compromising much. It doesn't require that we "weight" objectives in advance, their scaling doesn't matter. Instead we are presented with a
set of choices and can decide afterwards what we prefer. We can talk with 'Elsa Li' asking her what she prefers.
For this specific problem instance the number of choices is quite limited, which will not be the case with 
larger employee scheduling problem instances with more valid assignment choices. 

Edit and execute https://github.com/dietmarwo/fast-cma-es/blob/master/examples/employee.py[employee.py] to reproduce our results. Expect slower timings 
with older CPUs having less cores - we used a 16 core AMD 5950x. Remember `fcmaes` is mainly about utilizing all resources of modern
many core CPUs. 

=== Challenge

We modified the problem generating settings in 
https://github.com/optapy/optapy-quickstarts/blob/stable/employee-scheduling/services.py[services.py]
to generate a tougher challenge:

- More optional skills `["Anaesthetics", "Surgery", "Radiology"]`
- Roster length of 28 days:
- 20 employees 
- Skill distribution `skills = pick_subset(OPTIONAL_SKILLS, random, 1, 4, 4)`

[source,python]
----
OPTIONAL_SKILLS = ["Anaesthetics", "Surgery", "Radiology"]
...
    INITIAL_ROSTER_LENGTH_IN_DAYS = 28
...
    for i in range(20):
        skills = pick_subset(OPTIONAL_SKILLS, random, 1, 4, 4)
----

This is a setting OptaPy still can solve. We tried several time limits:

----
time spent (100056), best score (-1hard/-480soft), score calculation speed (84/sec) step total (280).
time spent (200053), best score (-1hard/-480soft), score calculation speed (61/sec) step total (609).
time spent (300029), best score (-1hard/-480soft), score calculation speed (46/sec) step total (755).
time spent (400011), best score (-1hard/-480soft), score calculation speed (52/sec) step total (1436).

20000 seconds is sufficient. We executed OptaPy 12 times using this limit and always got:

desired shift days 0

min shifts per employee 5
mean shifts per employee 12.6
std shifts per employee 3.8000000000000003
----

No desired work day fulfilled, and a quite large standard deviation of the shift assignemnts to the employees. 

We need to reconfigure the single objective optimization to adapt for the increased complexity:

[source,python]
----
    def optimize(self):
        self.fitness(np.random.uniform(0, len(self.employees), self.dim).astype(int))
        res = retry.minimize_plot("schedule.bite.4000k", Bite_cpp(4000000),  
        #res = retry.minimize_plot("schedule.de.10000k", De_cpp(10000000, popsize = 10000, ints = [True]*self.dim), 
        print(self.fitness_mo(res.x)) 
        self.show(res.x)

Note, that Differential Evolution now requires a huge population size. BiteOpt can still can solve the problem in a 
reasonable time of about 70 seconds:

Different BiteOpt runs produce the following solutions:

The last solution has a quite equal shift distribution and fulfills six work day desires. 
But from the second solution we see that not always all soft requirements are fulfilled, Dan Poe 
has to work at an undesired day.

For multi-objective optimization we also have to adapt the parameters:

[source,python]
----
        xs, ys = modecpp.retry(mode.wrapper(self.fitness_mo, 2), 
                 2, 0, self.bounds, popsize = 4096, max_evaluations = 20000000, 
             nsga_update=True, num_retries = 32, workers=32)
---- 

We find a pareto front:

== Conclusion

- Multi-objective optimization can provide the basis for the decision process even for large combinatorial scheduling problems.
- It can help to make employees "happy" by producing an employee schedule fulfilling all their "desires" and avoid having
no assigned shifts for some of them. 
- Performance of continuous optimization is sufficient even for large problem instances using Python, if https://numba.pydata.org/[numba]
is used to code the fitness function. 
- Modern continuous optimizers written in {cpp} like BiteOpt and fcmaes-MODE enable the evaluation of up to 10⁶ fitness evaluations/sec and are well suited
for decision variables used as discrete integer values. 
- The shown approach is very flexible regarding unusual constraints and modifications. Imagine assigning different weights to the fulfillment of soft constraints
for individual employees or other modifications. 
- Standard tools reach their limits soon, continuous optimization can sometimes still fulfill all hard and soft constraints, although
it can require many million fitness evaluations.  
- For problems where the requirements are very hard to fulfill, the pareto-front generated by multi-objective optimization 
can be very small - but still can offer interesting alternatives.
