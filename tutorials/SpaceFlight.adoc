== Space Flight Mission Design Revisited

=== This tutorial

- Discusses a specific mixed integer multi-objective space flight dynamics problem and show
the results applying different methods.  

=== Motivation

The development of fcmaes initially was driven by applications in the space flight mission design domain. 
When later focussing on other real world optimization problems, new (meta-)-algorithms were added. 
We will close the circle now by showing, if and how these new methods can be used to handle a specific multi-objective
mission design problem.

=== Planning the Cassini Mission. 

The original https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/missions/cassini/overview/[Cassini Mission]
to Saturn involved four gravity-assists at Venus, Venus, Earth and Jupiter to save fuel.

Now lets assume our task is to review the mission planning. Our planning team used domain knowledge
to decide which planets to visit in which order. But can we trust them? So we decide
just to ignore their intuition and let the optimization decide which route to take.

==== Optimizing Delta Velocity 

Lets first investigate the single objective problem where our goal is to minimize fuel consumption
expressed by the sum of the delta velocities caused by the thrust impulses necessary to
navigate the spaceship. Our first simplified flight model assumes we only apply impulses  
at the planet flybys before and after the gravity assist (GA) maneuvers. Between the planets we are
coasting. This way we only need 10 decision variables, 6 for the timings of the planet flybys and
4 for the planets we visit on our way. Here are the new boundaries for the decision variables:

----
    lb = [-1000.,30.,100.,30.,400.,1000., 1.501, 1.501, 1.501, 2.501],
    ub = [0.,400.,470.,400.,2000.,6000., 3.499, 3.499, 3.499, 5.499]       
----

We are restricting the planet selection based on domain knowledge, since we know for instance,
that we don't want to visit Pluto on our way to Saturn. Note that the objective function
rounds the planet to the next integer, so we defined the boundaries to assign the same
float interval to each planet selection. 

[source,python]
----    
    from fcmaes.astro import cassini1multi
    
    def cassini1(x):   
        y = cassini1multi(x)
        return y[0]
    
    advretry.minimize_plot("cassini1_mixed bm", de_cma(1500), cassini1, 
                               bounds, 10.0, 20.0, 5000, logger=logger())

----

Method `cassini1` simply selects the first objective (delta velocity) and we apply the 
boundary management meta algorithm (`advretry`) to perform a parallel retry of a 
DE->CMA-ES sequence. 

Excercise: Try other (meta-)algorithms.

As we can see, we find very fast solutions using sequence EVVE with suspiciously low dv 
of about 2.25 km/s. The planning team offered a solution > 8km/s, so either they 
overlooked a better planet sequence or our model is not accurate enough. We decide
to try a more accurate model: The new model allows for one additional deep space 
maneuver between two planets. This complicates the model significantly, since we now 
have to decide at which angle and height we pass the planets. This decision influences the
deviation of the flight path during the GA maneuver. The first model didn't consider this,  
because it could simply choose the optimal values minimizing delta velocity at the planet. 
With the new model this decision can have long term consequences several planets later on the path.

lb = [-1000,3,0,0,100,100,30,400,800,0.01,0.01,0.01,0.01,0.01,1.05,1.05,1.15,1.7, -math.pi, -math.pi, -math.pi, -math.pi, 1.501, 1.501, 1.501, 2.501],
up = [0,5,1,1,400,500,300,1600,2200,0.9,0.9,0.9,0.9,0.9,6,6,6.5,291,math.pi,  math.pi,  math.pi,  math.pi, 3.499, 3.499, 3.499, 5.499]     
----

The new model needs 26 decision variables, 22 to define the timings and flyby-parameters and 4 to decide which planet 
to visit. 

[source,python]
----    
    from fcmaes.astro import cassini2multi
    
    def cassini2(x):
        y = cassini2multi(x)
        return y[0]
    
    advretry.minimize_plot("cassini2_mixed bm", de_cma(1500), cassini2, 
                               bounds, 12.0, 20.0, 20000, logger=logger())

Now a "VVEJ" tour with dv = 8.38 is selected, as our planning team proposed. So they were correct after all, our first model was flawed. 
This problem is quite "tough" for optimization algorithms. Please notify me, if you find one which can solve this problem faster. 


==== Optimizing Delta Velocity and Flight Time

Our boss storms into the office: "Almost ten years, this takes too long". She asks us to explore alternatives: "It's ok if you need more delta velocity, we build
a more efficient engine". 

From the single objective case we know, that we need the complex model with 26 decision variables, which was already hard to solve. 
The second objective, the TOF (time of flight) is directly derived from the decision vector. From experience we know, that
such an objective may easily dominate a multi-objective optimization. There is no "best algorithm" for this kind of problem. 
Instead we decide to use multiple algorithms and "join" the computed pareto fronts. 

First lets apply `moretry.minimize` which applies the DE->CMA sequence using parallel retry weighting the two objectives differently 
for each run. We weight the TOF objective much lower to compensate  

- for the effect that optimization "prefers" the objective which is more directly related to the decision variables
- for the different scaling of the objectives (about 8 km/s, 2000 days)

[source,python]
----    
    from fcmaes.astro import cassini2multi
    from fcmaes import mode, moretry
    
    def cassini2_2(x):
        y = cassini2multi(x)
        return y[:2]
    
    x, y = moretry.minimize(mode.wrapper(cassini2_2, 2, interval = 10000000),
             bounds, weight_bounds = Bounds([0.1, 0.001], [1, 0.001]),
             ncon = 0, value_exp = 2.0, 
             num_retries = 50000, optimizer=de_cma(50000))
    np.savez_compressed("cassini2" + "de_cma50k", xs=x, ys=y)
    moretry.plot("cassini2" + "de_cma50k.5", 0, x, y, all=False, interp=True)

To complement the computed pareto front we use a "real" multi-objective algoritm, fcmaes MODE. 
To optimally utilize our CPU-cores we use parallel retry (instead of parallel function evaluation). 
This is a good choice for objective functions which are fast to evaluate. 
`modecpp.retry` executes parellel runs of the MODE algorithm, in this case 
using NSGA-II population update.

[source,python]
----    
  x, y = modecpp.retry(mode.wrapper(cassini2_2, 2, interval = 10000000), 2, 0,
                 bounds, popsize = 128, max_evaluations = 1000000,
                 nsga_update=True, num_retries = 256)
----

MODE cannot find the very best low DV solutions, but this time the "high DV" 
area with dv > 20 km/s is covered much better. We found solutions with TOF < 1500 days, 
which was not possible using `moretry`. 

Finally, to focus on the "middle section" we use DE population update:

[source,python]
----    
  x, y = modecpp.retry(mode.wrapper(cassini2_2, 2, interval = 10000000), 2, 0,
                 bounds, popsize = 128, max_evaluations = 1000000,
                 nsga_update=False, num_retries = 256)
----

Only by combining all three pareto fronts we can offer our boss the full set of alternatives. 

=== Conclusion

- Be careful with approximating models. The may over-simplify as does our first Cassini model
without deep space maneuvers. 
- Use a single objective algorithm to check what is possible.
- Be careful when one objective is hard to compute and another can simply be derived from the
decision variables.  
- Sometimes you have to combine solutions (pareto-fronts) using different methods to get a complete
multi-objective solution.
