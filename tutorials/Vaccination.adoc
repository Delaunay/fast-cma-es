=== Motivation

https://greenteapress.com/wp/modsimpy/[Modeling and Simulation] contains many good ideas 
how to implement simulations. It uses https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/api/pandas.Series.html[pandas.Series]
to implement the time series representing the course of a disease.  
The example shows, for a fixed overall budget, how different budged distributions over two counter measures: 

- Investing in a hand washing campaign.
- Investing in vaccine doses.

affects the final infection rate. This is done by simply iterating over all possible budged distributions.
But what, if the budged is not fixed and you want to find out for all possible investments:

- How should the money be distributed optimally?
- What is the final infection rate?

With only two input variables - the two investments - this can be easily be handled by a nested loop
iterating over all investments using a reasonable step size.  But what if there are more input variables / competing
objectives / constraints ? Or if the solution landscape is rugged, so we would need a very small step size ?
The multi-objective optimization approach applied to this problem may be overkill here, but it generalizes well
if we add more complexity. And it can perform simulations in parallel - although this may be easy to implement for a 
nested loop. For this example you may view multi-objective optimization as a kind of "intelligent" nested loop, 
which reduces the step size automatically near optimal investment distributions. 

But anyway, nested loop or multi-objective optimization, the execution time for a simulation performed using Python
can become an issue. Therefore we prefer a slightly different approach handling time series shown for instance in our 
https://github.com/dietmarwo/fast-cma-es/blob/master/tutorials/CryptoTrading.adoc[crypto trading tutorial]:

- Instead of a https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/api/pandas.Series.html[pandas.Series] (one dimensional) 
use a https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.html[pandas.DataFrame]. So instead representing the
series by a list of objects we represent each attribute as a separate list represented by the columns of the DataFrame.
The main advantage is that we can extract and assign these columns as numpy arrays and can feed them to a simulator inner loop
implemented using https://numba.pydata.org/[numba]. This can lead to a dramatic speed up of the simulation, which
comes very handy if it is called in a nested loop or for a multi-objective optimization.   
For the vaccination problem fortunately we don't need the time series at all, since we are only
interested in the final infection rate. This computation can easily be "delegated" to a simulation loop using 
https://numba.pydata.org/[numba].

=== Fast SIR simulation
The simulation of the disease uses the
https://scipython.com/book/chapter-8-scipy/additional-examples/the-sir-epidemic-model/[SIR epidemic model]
where SIR stands for

- S(t) are those susceptible but not yet infected with the disease.
- I(t) is the number of infectious individuals.
- R(t) are those individuals who have recovered from the disease and now have immunity to it.

The simulation can be accelerated by several orders of magnitude using https://numba.pydata.org/[numba] 
as follows:

[source,python]
----
    @njit(fastmath=True)
    def fast_update(s, i, r, beta, gamma):
        infected = beta * i * s    
        recovered = gamma * i       
        return s - infected, i + infected - recovered, r + recovered
    
    @njit(fastmath=True)
    def fast_simulate(s, i, r, t_end, beta, gamma):
        for t in range(0, t_end):
            s, i, r = fast_update(s, i, r, beta, gamma)
        return s, i, r   
----

`fast_simulate` replaces the `sweep_doses` from the original example code which fills 
`SRI` objects into a `pandas.Series`. The acceleration may not really be needed for
this small example, but for bigger simulations it is essential that all inner loops
are executed using https://numba.pydata.org/[numba].

[source,python]
----
    def sweep_doses(dose_array):
        sweep = SweepSeries()
        
        for doses in dose_array:
            fraction = doses / num_students
            spending = budget - doses * price_per_dose
            
            system = make_system(beta, gamma)
            add_immunization(system, fraction)
            add_hand_washing(system, spending)
            
            results = run_simulation(system, update_func)
            sweep[doses] = calc_total_infected(results, system)
    
        return sweep
----

We also could produce the whole series using https://numba.pydata.org/[numba]
if needed - and store the resulting arrays in a `pandas.DataFrame`:

[source,python]
----
    @njit(fastmath=True)
    def fast_simulate(s, i, r, t_end, beta, gamma):
        sa = np.empty(t_end+1)
        ia = np.empty(t_end+1)
        ra = np.empty(t_end+1)
        sa[0] = s
        ia[0] = i
        ra[0] = r
        for t in range(1, t_end+1):
            s, i, r = fast_update(s, i, r, beta, gamma)
            sa[t] = s
            ia[t] = i
            ra[t] = r
        return sa, ia, ra
----

=== Objective Fitness Function

How can we design the fitness function guiding the optimization process?
Result should be a set of non-dominating solutions - a pareto-front - which
corresponds to "good" or "interesting" solutions we would produce using a 
nested loop iterating first over the vaccination
budged and then over the hand-washing campaign spending. We are interested 
into solutions with a low combined budged, so we define the sum
'budged_doses + spending` as one of our objectives, the infection rate
`infected` as the other one. 

[source,python]
----
class fcmaes_problem():
    
    def __init__(self):
        self.dim = 2
        self.bounds = Bounds([0]*self.dim, [budget]*self.dim)     
        
    def simulate(self, budged_doses, spending):     
        doses = budged_doses / price_per_dose
        fraction = doses / num_students         
        system = make_system(beta, gamma)
        add_immunization(system, fraction)
        add_hand_washing(system, spending)          
        results = run_simulation(system, update_func)
        return calc_total_infected(results, system)

    def fitness2(self, x):
        budged_doses = x[0]
        spending = x[1]                        
        infected = self.simulate(budged_doses, spending)
        return [infected, budged_doses + spending]

    def fitness3(self, x):
        budged_doses = x[0]
        spending = x[1]                        
        infected = self.simulate(budged_doses, spending)
        return [infected, budged_doses, spending]
    
problem = fcmaes_problem()    
----

Additionally we define
an objective function `fitness3` which separates both budgets to 
create a 3 dimensional chart visualizing the structure of all budged 
distributions in relation to the resulting infection rate.

=== Compute the 2-objective Pareto Front

fcmaes offers two different parallelization modes:

==== Parallel function evaluation

In this mode a single optimization performs function evaluations in parallel. 
Advantage: Faster convergence, you need less evaluations to produce a good 
set of non dominated solutions (pareto-front).

[source,python]
----
    xs, ys = mode.minimize(mode.wrapper(problem.fitness2, 3, interval=1000), 3, 
               problem.ncon, problem.bounds, 
               popsize = 256, max_evaluations = 25600, nsga_update=False, 
               workers=8)
----

==== Result

image::vaccine2dmode.png[]

Only 8 workers are defined because the overhead for parallelization is high, 
more workers would not improve the evaluation rate further. If the fitness evaluation is
more expensive, it dominates the parallelization overhead, so this problem disappears. 
Because of our `numba` based "tuning" we get about 1450 evaluations/sec using parallel 
function evaluation, and about 6800 evaluations/sec using parallel optimization on
a 16 core / 32 thread AMD 5950 CPU. The whole optimization produces a 512 solution pareto 
front in about 17 seconds for parallel function evaluation (25000 evaluations) and a 7573 solution pareto front
in about 83 seconds (561000 evaluations)

For comparison; The original non-numba simulation performs 277 simulations / sec 
using parallel function evaluation, and about 286 evaluations/sec using parallel optimization. 
You need to set `workers=32`
for 'mode.minimize` to fully utilize the CPU, since the parallelization overhead now is 
smaller compared to the cost of a function evaluation. 

==== Parallel optimization

In this mode the whole optimization is performed in parallel. Advantage: Better
scaling, more evaluations per second. Disadvantage: Slower convergence, you need
more evaluations - but you get more solutions in the pareto front:

[source,python]
----
    xs, ys = modecpp.retry(mode.wrapper(problem.fitness2, 2, interval=1000), 2, 
               0, problem.bounds, popsize = 128, max_evaluations = 12800, 
               nsga_update=False, num_retries = 64, workers=32)
    moretry.plot("pandemy", 0, xs, ys)
----

image::vaccine2dretry.png[]

==== Interpretation of the result

Parallel optimization produces more detailed picture, since because of the 
improved parallelization-scaling we can compute a bigger solution.

We see that:

- We should not invest more than 800 for the hand-washing campaign, since
for a final infection rate < 0.20 only more money invested in vaccination helps. 
- As long as we invest 800 for the hand-washing campaign, each increase of the vaccination
budged further reduces the final infection rate significantly.
- If our overall budged is between 400-800, all the money should go to the hand-washing campaign. 
- If it is less than 400, all the money should be invested in vaccination. 

Did you expect this result? I was surprised. 

=== Compute the 3-objective Pareto Front

We use the same algorithms, this time applied to the 3-objective fitness variant `fitness3`.
Performance is very similar to the 2d-variant, but this time we see how both campaign spending and
vaccination budged influence the final infection rate. 

==== Parallel function evaluation

[source,python]
----
    xs, ys = mode.minimize(mode.wrapper(problem.fitness3, 3, interval=1000), 3, 
                0, problem.bounds, popsize = 512, max_evaluations = 25600, 
                nsga_update=False, workers=8)
    plot3d(xs, ys, task)
----

==== Result

This time we produce two pictures, one using a heatmap to represent the 3rd dimension:

image::vaccine3dmode.png[]

And one using a 3d-perspective:

image::vaccine3dmode2.png[]

When you execute the example you will notice that this time you can play with the picture in 
the browser. This is an important feature which helps to actually understand the 3d result. 

==== Parallel optimization

[source,python]
----
    xs, ys = modecpp.retry(mode.wrapper(problem.fitness3, 3, interval=1000), 3, 
                0, problem.bounds, popsize = 256, max_evaluations = 25600, 
                nsga_update=False, workers=32)
    plot3d(xs, ys, task)
----

Again we get a more detailed picture using parallel optimization, since, because of the 
improved parallelization-scaling we can compute a bigger solution this way. Note that this
is not the case for expensive objective functions, because then both methods scale similarly.

==== Conclusion

- fcmaes multi objective optimization can be used to replace a nested loop enumerating all solutions
produced by a simulation. 
- Advantages for this kind of application are
    * Automatic parallelization.
    * Automatic adjustment of the step size.
- Visualization of the multi-dimensional solution landscapes can assist the decision making process.
- If the solution landscape is rugged, if there are many dimensions, objectives or constraints,
a nested loop will no longer work.
