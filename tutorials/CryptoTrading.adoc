= Optimizing Crypto Trading Strategies

This tutorial shows:

- How to retrieve and cache historical ticker data.
- How to implement a very fast trading simulation using https://numba.pydata.org/[numba].
- How to optimize trading strategy parameters for multiple tickers simultaneously.
- How to optimize multiple objectives - one for each ticker - thereby fulfilling several constraints.
- How to visualize the resulting strategy applied to different cryptos. 

This is not a tutorial about trading strategies. Instead it shows how an existing strategy
may be parameterized and how we find parameters fitting to the cryptos we want to trade. 
This concept can be applied to any trading strategy, as long as we succeed in implementing
an efficient simulation based on historical data. We can not only optimize for
a single objective. Computing the pareto front for multiple objectives may give interesting
insights in the specific "compatibility" of parameter settings to a subset of the cryptos we
plan to trade. This works even if we require specific constraints - like an upper limit on 
the number of trades - to be fulfilled. 

Note that this tutorial was tested on Windows but performs significantly worse (> factor 3) 
than on Linux because of limitations of Python multi-threading on Windows. 
Switch to Linux or the Linux subsystem on Windows whenever possible.  

==== Key ideas

The key ideas how to implement an efficient simulation are: 

- Pre-computation of all time series data relevant for the strategy and storing it in a pandas data frame.
- Use pandas .to_numpy() method to convert all time series data into numpy arrays forwarded to the simulation.
- Use https://numba.pydata.org/[numba] to implement the simulation based on the time series arrays. 

The tricky part is related to the current limitations of https://numba.pydata.org/[numba]. 
numba more or less can only operate on numpy 
arrays. This complicates the implementation of the logging of the trading actions - buy and sell.
We need that not for the optimization process itself, but for the graphical visualization of the optimization result.  
 
Although our example strategy is quite trivial, we still get a significant improvement
over the HODL strategy. 

==== The HODL strategy used as reference point

https://www.investopedia.com/terms/h/hodl.asp[HODL] stands for "hold on for dear life" and is
a trading strategy popular in the crypto-scene. As it is true also for many stocks:
Long term the price of bigger cryptos like BitCoin, Ethereum, XRP or ADA always increased in the past. 

This strategy - investing all at the beginning of the trading time interval and selling 
all at the end - serves as a "reference". We want to maximize the return of investment (ROI)
for a specific strategy divided by the HODL-ROI for that crypto-coin. 

==== EMA / SMA exponential and simple moving average

Our example strategy implemented here is very simple. Its purpose is to show 
how to implement an efficient simulation / optimization based on any strategy. It is not meant to be
applied in "real life". From
https://www.fidelity.com/learning-center/trading-investing/technical-analysis/technical-indicator-guide/ema[EMA/SMA]:
"Exponential Moving Average (EMA) is similar to Simple Moving Average (SMA), measuring trend direction over a period of time. 
However, whereas SMA simply calculates an average of price data, EMA applies more weight to data that is more current".

We can now use the "crossing" of EMA, which is more closely following the current price, with the SMA as a buy / sell signal. 
Both EMA and SMA have a "window-size" parameter which determines how many price data values from the past are used. 
A larger window means EMA/SMA will slow down in following the actual price. 

We buy when the EMA crosses the SMA from below to above, we sell if the crossing is in the opposite direction. 
But what if the "crossing" is only short term and soon reverted? To avoid that we introduce two more
parameters: 

- Minimal wait time after the last sell to buy (min wait buy)
- Minimal wait time after the last buy to sell (min wait sell)

To simplify things we invest always all our cash and sell all our cryptos.
Each simulation involves only one ticker (like BitCoin), but we will perform
simulations for multiple tickers with the same parameters and add the results to reduce overfitting. 

To recap: There are four input parameters for our example EMA/SMA strategy:

- EMA window size
- SMA window size
- min wait buy (after last sell)
- min wait sell (after last buy)

==== Example Plot

This tutorial is based on https://github.com/dietmarwo/fast-cma-es/blob/master/examples/crypto.py[crypto.py]. 
Adapt this code to perform your own experiments. The following diagram was produced using the code below:

image::ema_sma.png[]

[source,python]
----
if __name__ == '__main__':
    tickers = ['ADA-USD']
    start="2019-01-01"
    end="2030-04-30" 
    fit = fitness(tickers, start, end) 
    fit.plot([20,60,10,10])
----

- The blue line represents SMA-60
- The orange line represents EMA-20
- The green line is the value of our crypto coins + our cash.

The green line follows the price change if we are invested and is flat otherwise - in that case we hold cash.   
We see that we buy and sell at the crossings of the orange with the blue line. By holding cash at the end
we avoid loosing money. But as we see we neither bought at the bottom nor sold at the top.  
The exact position of bottom and top is hard to predict.

`fitness` represents our objective function used for the optimization. This class performs the simulation 
based on historical data - either for optimization or, as here, to visualize specific parameters. 
`fit.plot([20,60,10,10])` gets the parameters we want to visualize:

- EMA window size 20 days
- SMA window size 60 days
- min wait buy (after last sell) 10 days
- min wait sell (after last buy) 10 days

[source,python]
----
class fitness(object):

    def __init__(self, tickers, start, end, max_trades = None):
        self.evals = mp.RawValue(ct.c_int, 0) 
        self.best_y = mp.RawValue(ct.c_double, math.inf) 
        self.t0 = time.perf_counter()
        self.tickers = tickers
        self.max_trades = max_trades
        self.histories = {}
        self.closes = {}
        self.dates = {}
        self.hodls = {}
        for ticker in tickers:
            self.histories[ticker] = get_history(ticker, start=start, end=end)
            self.closes[ticker] = self.histories[ticker].Close
            self.dates[ticker] = np.array([d.strftime('%Y.%m.%d') for d in self.histories[ticker].index])
            self.hodls[ticker] = hodl(self.closes[ticker].to_numpy(), START_CASH)                      
----

For each ticker the pandas data frame representing the historical data is stored in `self.histories[ticker]`.
Everything which can be precomputated at this stage (which is not dependent on the strategy parameters we want 
to optimize) is stored as numpy arrays (`self.dates`) or as values (`self.hodls`). Both EMA and SMA
are parameter dependent, we have to defer their computation and store the close prices they depend on 
as pandas time series ('self.closes[ticker]'). Values shared over process boundaries (for instance the
best value achieved so far in all threads `best.y`), are stored as `mp.RawValue`.  

==== Caching historical ticker data

`fitness` checks its local cache if the requested historical data is already there and 
downloads it if necessary (`get_history(ticker, start=start, end=end)`). 
Note that this 'cache' is quite dumb: If you change either
start or end date the whole interval is downloaded and stored as compressed csv files 
in `fast-cma-es/examples/ticker_cache`.
There is no intelligent "merging" with data already there. 
You may use an end date in the future to download all data until now, but there is no 
update as long as the end date is the same.

==== Single objective optimization

Applying single objective optimization our goal is to maximize the average strategy-ROI / HODL-ROI for a number of tickers. 
In the example code we use BitCoin, Ethereum, XRP and ADA, but you may adapt the example using different tickers.
See https://finance.yahoo.com/lookup[ticker name search] for their names.

[source,python]
----
    def fun(self, x):
        # simulate the EMS/SMA strategy for all tickers
        factors = []
        num_trades = []
        for ticker in self.tickers:    
            # convert the optimization variables into integers and use them to configure the simulation
            f, num, _ = simulate(self.closes[ticker], int(x[0]), int(x[1]), int(x[2]), int(x[3]))
            factors.append(f)  
            num_trades.append(num)          
        factor = np.prod(factors) ** (1.0/len(factors)) # normalize the accumulated factor
        y = -factor # our optimization algorithm minimizes the resulting value, we maximize factor
----

`fun` is shared for the single.objective `__call__(self, x)`) and the multi-objective case `mofun(self, x)`
It computes the geometric mean of the 'f = strategy-ROI / HODL-ROI' values which are to be maximized. 

[source,python]
----
def simulate(prices, ema_period, sma_period, wait_buy, wait_sell, dates=None):
    close = prices.to_numpy()
    ema = get_ema(prices, ema_period)
    sma = get_sma(prices, sma_period) 
    return strategy(close, START_CASH, ema, sma, wait_buy, wait_sell, dates)
----

`simulate` applies the parameters do compute EMA and SMA using panda built in functions and then calls `strategy` which
executes the strategy and is annotated with `@njit`. This means it is accelerated by https://numba.pydata.org/[numba].
It is essential that we keep out the slow Python interpreter for this very time critical part of the code.  

Because of numba limitations `strategy` cannot do any logging itself. Instead it optionally stores the trading history - 
when we buy or sell - in a list of strings `logs`. This functionality is not needed by the objective function, 
but later when we want to plot the resulting strategy. 

Lets try it out. Adapt and execute https://github.com/dietmarwo/fast-cma-es/blob/master/examples/crypto.py[crypto.py]
as follows:

[source,python]
----
if __name__ == '__main__':
    tickers = ['BTC-USD', 'ETH-USD', 'XRP-USD', 'ADA-USD']
    start="2019-01-01"
    end="2030-04-30" 
    fit = fitness(tickers, start, end) 
    optimize(tickers, start, end)
----

We get as output:

----

`hodl = 10.976` means that using the HODL-strategy we would have increased our initial investment by about factor 11
from 2019 until now. No wonder many are interested in crptos these days, and also that the HODL strategy is popular. 
The final result of the optimization after performing 34236 simulations in about 2.6 seconds is
`x = [26, 57, 24, 98]` which means we use EMA-26, SMA-57 and wait at least 24 days before buying and 98 days before selling
even if we got the signal. This strategy works well with BTC, XRP and ADA, but not so well with ETHER (only factor 1.1). 

That we could execute > 10000 simulations each second - on an AMD 5950x 16 core CPU using 32 parallel threads - shows
that there is a lot of room for more advanced and time consuming strategies. It wouldn't really matter if the
optimization needs 2 hours instead of 2 seconds.  

==== How to fight FOMO

How much did we earn on average applying the optimized strategy parameters? Its the HODL-factor multiplied with 
`2.283`, the final value of our single objective, which is factor 2.283 * 10.976 = 25. We would have been 25 times 
richer in about 3 years. This explains why https://cryptocurrencyfacts.com/fud-and-fomo-explained/[FOMO] (fear of missing out)
is such a thing in the crypto scene. You can fight FOMO easily by reading one of the 400 
Bitcoin https://99bitcoins.com/bitcoin-obituaries/[obituaries] - stating that its value soon will become zero.   
Another idea is to switch the start and end date of the optimization to cover a bear market time window. 
In practice FOMO and its counterpart FUD (Fear, Uncertainty, and Doubt) are your friend, because fear 
driven emotional actions performed by traders are the exact thing we plan to exploit using trading strategies. 

Note that we didn't account for fees/taxes and leave this as an exercise to the reader. 

==== Which trades where performed?

And finally we see the four plots corresponding to the four coin tickers we used:

image::crypto_opt.png[]

Which show again that its only Ethereum having problems with our strategy. 
This is the code triggering the optimization and generating the plots:

[source,python]
----
def optimize(tickers, start, end):
    bounds = Bounds([20,50,10,10], [50,100,200,200])
    fit = fitness(tickers, start, end) 
    ret = retry.minimize(fit, bounds, logger = None, num_retries=32, optimizer=Bite_cpp(2000))
    fit.plot(ret.x)
----

We define the lower and upper bounds for each strategy parameter - different 
bounds will result in different solutions. The used optimizer `Bite_cpp(2000)`
(https://github.com/avaneev/biteopt[BiteOpt] from Aleksey Vaneev configured to execute
2000 simulations for each parallel retry) can be replaced, fmaes offers 
plenty alternatives. But you don't really have to care about that, BiteOpt
works very well for crypto trading strategy optmization. 

=== Multi Objective optimization

For multi-objective optimization we compute the pareto front (a set of non-redundant / non-dominated solutions) 
with different good strategy-ROI / HODL-ROI factors for each ticker. Additionally we implement simple example constraints: 
we limit the maximal number of trades for each ticker. 
 
What are the advantages of applying a multi-objective algorithm over using the weighted sum approach?

- The scale of the objectives doesn't matter. We could directly go for the strategy-ROI without normalization using the HODL-ROI. 
- Constraints will be prioritized, but only until they are fulfilled. Their scaling doesn't matter as for the objectives. 

Disadvantage is that we usually need more simulations, without https://numba.pydata.org/[numba] we would be lost. 
 
Investigating the pareto front reveals if there is one crypto coin "incompatible" with the others regarding our strategy parameters. 
In this case we could separately optimize only for this coin - risking overfitting - or alternatively just remove it from our set. 

[source,python]
----
    def mofun(self, x):
        _, factors, num_trades = self.fun(x)
        ys = [-f for f in factors] # higher factor is better
        constraints = [ntr - self.max_trades for ntr in num_trades] # at most max_trades trades
        return np.array(ys + constraints)
----

The multi-objective fitness function concatenates the objectives `[-f for f in factors]` and the constraints
`[ntr - self.max_trades for ntr in num_trades]` and returns the result.

- Why do we change the sign of the objectives? The optimizer always minimizes both objectives and constraints > 0, so 
we have to change the sign in order to maximize our profit. 
- How does the optimizer know what are objectives and what are constraints? The optimizer gets the number of objectives as
configuration parameter and assumes they are first.
- What does the optimizer differently with constraints? Constraints are prioritized as long as they are violated (c > 0). If not
(c <= 0) they are ignored in the optimization process. 
- Is the scaling of objectives / constraints relevant? No the optimizer treats all objectives equal independent from their scaling. 
- What about equality constraints `(a = b)`? Code them as `c = abs(a-b)`, then the optimizer will try to make a and b equal.  
Or use `c = abs(a-b) - eps` if you can tolerate an inequality < `eps`.
- What if you want to parameterize the order of a sequence of trading activities? Use input parameters in the `[0,1]` interval
and apply `numpy.argsort` to them to get a sequence of integers representing an ordering. See https://github.com/dietmarwo/fast-cma-es/blob/master/tutorials/TSP.adoc[noisy TSP] for an example. 

The answers to these questions nicely summarize why it makes sense to use a multi-objective optimizer in the first place instead
of relying on the weighted sum approach and using a single objective optimizer. Parallel retry using varying weights as supported 
by fcmaes can partly compensate for these issues. 

[source,python]
----
def optimize_mo(tickers, start, end, nsga_update = True):
    nobj = len(tickers) # number of objectives
    ncon = nobj # number of constraints
    max_trades = 8
    fit = fitness(tickers, start, end, max_trades) 
    bounds = Bounds([20,50,10,10], [50,100,200,200])
    xs, front = modecpp.retry(fit.mofun, len(tickers), ncon, bounds, num_retries=32, popsize = 48, max_evaluations = 16000, nsga_update = nsga_update, logger = logger())

This code shows how the `modecpp`optimizer is called. Instead of a single run we trigger as many parallel retries as your
processor supports. After that the pareto front representing all parallel retries is returned (`xs, front`). 
`xs` represent the strategy parameters and `ys` their objective / constraint values as result of applying the configured
trading strategy. Different to single objective optimization fcmaes doesn't offer an alternative optimization algorithm 
to https://github.com/dietmarwo/fast-cma-es/blob/master/tutorials/MODE.adoc[modecpp] beside its Python implementation
https://github.com/dietmarwo/fast-cma-es/blob/master/fcmaes/mode.py[mode.py] since multi objective optimization is not yet
as established as single objective optimization. But at least you can configure its population update mechanism
`nsga_update`. You may choose between NSGA-II and differential evolution population update. If you don't know what this means: 
You don't need to, the default `nsga_update = True` is fine for crypto trading strategy optimization. 

Lets try it out. Adapt and execute https://github.com/dietmarwo/fast-cma-es/blob/master/examples/crypto.py[crypto.py]
as follows:

[source,python]

if __name__ == '__main__':
    tickers = ['BTC-USD', 'ETH-USD', 'XRP-USD', 'ADA-USD']
    start="2019-01-01"
    end="2030-04-30" 
    fit = fitness(tickers, start, end) 
    optimize_mo(tickers, start, end)

As result we see:

The best factor we see (`fac = 2.054`) is lower than for single objective optimization because of the additional 
constraints - which by the way are violated in this instance, we see `ntr = [10, 10, 10, 10]` ten trades instead
of our limit 8. Reason is that this output only monitors progress for the "single objective", not for
the constraints. But then we see a dump of the whole pareto front:

Most of the solutions fulfill the constraint - we could filter 
out these which don't.
