= fcmaes - a Python 3 gradient-free optimization library

fcmaes complements https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/optimize.html[scipy optimize] by providing 
additional optimization methods, faster {cpp}/Eigen based implementations and a coordinated parallel retry mechanism. 
It supports the multi threaded application of different gradient free optimization algorithms. The coordinated retry
can be viewed as a new meta algorithm operating on a population of user defined optimization runs. Its default
optimization algorithm is a sequence of differential evolution and CMA-ES well suited for many ill conditioned,
non-continous objective functions.

=== Features

- fcmaes is focused on optimization problems hard to solve.
- Minimized algorithm overhead - relative to the objective function evaluation time - even for high dimensions. 
- Parallel coordinated retry of sequences and random choices of optimization algorithms. See https://github.com/dietmarwo/fast-cma-es/blob/master/Expressions.adoc[Expressions].
- Parallel function evaluation for CMA-ES
- New DE (differential evolution) variant optimized for usage with parallel coordinated retry and the DE->CMA sequence.
- Fast C++ implementations of CMA-ES, differential evolution, dual annealing and the Harris hawks algorithm.
- Integrates https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/optimize.html[scipy] and https://nlopt.readthedocs.io/en/latest/NLopt_Algorithms/[NLopt] optimization algorithms for use with the coordinated retry.
- Parallel retry for https://esa.github.io/pagmo2/docs/cpp/cpp_docs.html#implemented-algorithms[PAGMO2] algorithms and problems.

=== Optimization algorithms

- CMA-ES: Implemented both in Python and in {cpp}. The Python version is faster than
https://github.com/CMA-ES/pycma/tree/master/cma[CMA] but slower than the {cpp} variant. The Python variant provides an ask/tell interface and supports parallel function evaluation. Both CMA variants provide less configurability than https://github.com/CMA-ES/pycma/blob/master/cma[CMA].

- Dual Annealing: Implemented in {cpp}. Use the scipy implementation if you prefer a pure python variant or need more configuration options. 

- Differential Evolution: Implemented in {cpp}. There is no python equivalent, the scipy implementation 
works differently. Additional concepts implemented here are 
https://www.researchgate.net/publication/309179699_Differential_evolution_for_protein_folding_optimization_based_on_a_three-dimensional_AB_off-lattice_model[temporal locality] and stochastic reinitialization of individuals based on their age. 

- Harris hawks: Implemented in {cpp}. Use https://github.com/7ossam81/EvoloPy/blob/master/optimizers/HHO.py[HHO] if you prefer a pure python variant. See Harris hawks optimization: Algorithm and applications Ali Asghar Heidari, Seyedali Mirjalili, Hossam Faris, Ibrahim Aljarah, Majdi Mafarja, Huiling Chen, Future Generation Computer Systems,  DOI: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.future.2019.02.028 .

- Expressions: There are two operators for constructing expressions over optimization algorithms: Sequence and random choice.
Not only the three algorithms above, but also scipy and NLopt optimization methods and custom algorithms can be used for defining algorithm expressions. Default method for the parallel retry is the sequence DE -> CMA with the evaluation budget equally distributed.

=== Usage

Usage is similar to https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.optimize.minimize.html[scipy.optimize.minimize].

For coordinated parallel retry use:

[source,python]
----
from fcmaes.optimizer import logger
from fcmaes import advretry
ret = advretry.minimize(fun, bounds, logger=logger())
----

`advretry.minimize` has many parameters for fine tuning, but in most of the cases the default settings work well. 

In https://github.com/dietmarwo/fast-cma-es/blob/master/examples/advexamples.py[tutorial.py] and https://github.com/dietmarwo/fast-cma-es/blob/master/examples/advexamples.py[advexamples.py] you find examples for the coordinated retry. 
Parallel retry does not support initial quess `x0` and initial step size `input_sigma` parameters because it
uses generated guesses and step size values. The default logger logs both into a file and to stdout. 
For easy problems it is sometimes better to use the simple parallel retry:

[source,python]
----
from fcmaes.optimizer import logger
from fcmaes import retry
ret = retry.minimize(fun, bounds, logger=logger())
----

The simple retry logs mean and standard deviation of the results, so it can be used to test and compare optimization algorithms:

[source,python]
----
opt = ...
ret = retry.minimize(fun, bounds, logger=logger(), optimizer=opt)
----

Here https://github.com/dietmarwo/fast-cma-es/blob/master/examples/examples.py[examples.py] you find examples for the simple retry.
The single threaded Python CMA-ES implementation is used as follows:

[source,python]
----
from fcmaes import cmaes
ret = cmaes.minimize(fun, bounds, x0)
print (ret.x, ret.fun, ret.nfev)
----

If the initial guess x0 is undefined,
a feasible uniformly distributed random value is automatically generated. It is recommended to define
bounds, since CMA-ES uses them also for internal scaling. Additional parameters are

- `popsize` (default 31) - Size of the population used. Instead of increasing this parameter for hard problems, it is often better to use parallel retry instead. Reduce `popsize` for a narrower search if your budget is restricted.
- `input_sigma` (default 0.3) - The initial step size. Can be defined for each dimension separately. Both parallel retry mechanism
  set this parameter together with the initial guess automatically.   
- `is_parallel` (default False) - Calls the objective function for the whole population in parallel. Useful for costly 
  objective functions but is switched off when you use parallel retry.    
  
For the {cpp} variant use instead:

[source,python]
----
from fcmaes import cmaescpp
ret = cmaescpp.minimize(fun, bounds, x0)
----

Alternatively there is an ask/tell interface to interact with CMA-ES:

[source,python]
----
es = cmaes.Cmaes(bounds, x0)
for i in range(iterNum):
    xs = es.ask()
    ys = [fun(x) for x in xs]
    status = es.tell(ys)
    if status != 0:
        break 
----

Differential evolution (fcmaes.decpp), Dual Annealing (fcmaes.dacpp) and Harris hawks (fcmaes.hhcpp) provide similar interfaces. 
[source,python]
----
from fcmaes import decpp, dacpp
ret = decpp.minimize(fun, bounds)
ret = dacpp.minimize(fun, bounds, x0)
----

=== Log output of the parallel retry

The log output of the parallel retry contains the following rows:

===== Simple retry

- time (in sec)
- evaluations / sec
- number of retries - optimization runs
- total number of evaluations in all retries
- best value found so far
- mean of the values found by the retries below the defined threshold
- standard deviation of the values found by the retries below the defined threshold
- list of the best 20 function values in the retry store
- best solution (x-vector) found so far

Mean and standard deviation would be misleading when using advanced retry, because
of the retries initiated by crossover. Therefore the rows of the
log output differ slightly:
 
===== Advanced coordinated retry

- time (in sec)
- evaluations / sec
- number of retries - optimization runs
- total number of evaluations in all retries
- best value found so far
- worst value in the retry store
- number of entries in the retry store
- list of the best 20 function values in the retry store
- best solution (x-vector) found so far

=== Comparison with PYGMO/Archipelago

There are different ways to enable parallelization and the exchange of information between optimization runs. Two examples are:

* The approach implemented in fcmaes:
- Topology of the parallelization is hidden from the user. A simple "minimize" call hides the complexity. Parallelism is implemented using multi-processing which scales better than
multi-threading with the number of available processor cores.  
* The https://esa.github.io/pagmo2/docs/cpp/archipelago.html[Archipelago] approach as implemented in https://esa.github.io/pagmo2/[PAGMO2]:
- Topology has to be defined by the user including how nodes/ https://esa.github.io/pagmo2/docs/cpp/island.html[islands] exchange members of their populations. Members of these
populations are solution vectors. This approach gives more control to the user but there is no simple default "minimize" call hiding the complexity. As default parallelism is implemented using multi-threading but it is possible to use multi-processing or even distributed CPUs.  
- Exchange of information between parallel PAGMO threads is based on exchanging population members, which doesn't fit well with CMA-ES which recreates its whole population each generation.  

PYGMO/PAGMO has direct support of constraints and multiple objectives. fcmaes supports parallel retry of PYGMO problems and algorithms, see https://github.com/dietmarwo/fast-cma-es/blob/master/Constraints.adoc[Constraints Tutorial].

=== Performance

On a single AMD 3950x CPU using https://repo.anaconda.com/archive/Anaconda3-2019.10-Linux-x86_64.sh[Anaconda 2019.10]
for Linux the parallel coordinated retry mechanism 
solves ESAs 26-dimensional https://www.esa.int/gsp/ACT/projects/gtop/messenger_full/[Messenger full] problem
in about 2 hours on average. The Messenger full benchmark models a
multi-gravity assist interplanetary space mission from Earth to Mercury. In 2009 the first good solution (6.9 km/s)
was submitted. It took more than five years to reach 1.959 km/s and three more years until 2017 to find the optimum 
http://www.midaco-solver.com/index.php/component/content/article?id=208[1.958 km/s]. The picture below shows the
progress of the whole science community since 2009:

image::Fsc.png[]  

The following picture shows 173 retry runs, each about 1 hour. 

image::mf3.6000.png[]  

91 out of these 173 runs produced a result better than 2 km/s:

image::mf3.2000.png[] 

69, more than a third reached the absolute minimum at 1.958 km/s. 

image::mf3.1959.png[] 

Using fcmaes with parallel retry performs > 800000 messenger_full evaluations per second
on an AMD 3950x processor. This outperforms both the official
https://github.com/CMA-ES/pycma[CMA-ES] implementation and scipy differential evolution.
