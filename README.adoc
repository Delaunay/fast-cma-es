fcmaes complements https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/optimize.html[scipy optimize] by providing 
additional optimization methods, faster {cpp}/Eigen based implementations and a coordinated parallel retry mechanism. 
It supports the multi threaded application of different gradient free optimization algorithms. 
There are 34 real world https://github.com/dietmarwo/fast-cma-es/blob/master/tutorials/Tutorials.adoc[tutorials]
showing in detail how to use fcmaes. 
See https://github.com/dietmarwo/fast-cma-es/blob/master/tutorials/Performance.adoc[performance]
for detailed fcmaes performance figures. 

fcmaes started as a fast CMA-ES implementation combined with a new smart parallel retry mechanism aimed to solve
hard optimization problems from the space flight planning domain. It evolved to a general library of
state-of-the-art gradient free optimization algorithms applicable to all kind of real world problems covering
multi-objective and constrained problems. Its main algorithms are implemented both in Python and C++ and
support both parallel fitness function evaluation and a parallel retry mechanism.

=== Optimization algorithms

To utilize modern many-core processors all single-objective algorithms should be used with the parallel retry for cheap fitness functions, otherwise use parallel function evaluation.  

- MO-DE: A new multi-objective optimization algorithm merging concepts from differential evolution and NSGA. 
Implemented both in https://github.com/dietmarwo/fast-cma-es/blob/master/fcmaes/mode.py[Python] and in https://github.com/dietmarwo/fast-cma-es/blob/master/_fcmaescpp/modeoptimizer.cpp[C++]. Provides an ask/tell interface and supports constraints and parallel function evaluation. 
Can also be applied to single-objective problems with constraints. Supports mixed integer problems (see https://github.com/dietmarwo/fast-cma-es/blob/master/tutorials/FluidDynamics.adoc[CFD] for details)

- BiteOpt algorithm from Aleksey Vaneev https://github.com/avaneev/biteopt[BiteOpt]. Only a C++ version is provided. If your problem is single objective and if you have no clue what algorithm to apply, try this first. Works well with almost all problems. For constraints you have to use weighted penalties.

- Differential Evolution: Implemented both in https://github.com/dietmarwo/fast-cma-es/blob/master/fcmaes/de.py[Python] and in https://github.com/dietmarwo/fast-cma-es/blob/master/_fcmaescpp/deoptimizer.cpp[C++]. Additional concepts implemented are 
https://www.researchgate.net/publication/309179699_Differential_evolution_for_protein_folding_optimization_based_on_a_three-dimensional_AB_off-lattice_model[temporal locality], stochastic reinitialization of individuals based on their age and oscillating CR/F parameters. Provides an ask/tell interface and supports parallel function evaluation. Supports mixed integer problems (see https://github.com/dietmarwo/fast-cma-es/blob/master/tutorials/FluidDynamics.adoc[CFD] for details)

- CMA-ES: Implemented both in https://github.com/dietmarwo/fast-cma-es/blob/master/fcmaes/cmaes.py[Python] and in https://github.com/dietmarwo/fast-cma-es/blob/master/_fcmaescpp/acmaesoptimizer.cpp[C++]. Provides an ask/tell interface and supports parallel function evaluation.

- CR-FM-NES: Fast Moving Natural Evolution Strategy for High-Dimensional Problems, see 
    https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.11422. Derived from https://github.com/nomuramasahir0/crfmnes .
Implemented both in https://github.com/dietmarwo/fast-cma-es/blob/master/fcmaes/crfmnes.py[Python] and in https://github.com/dietmarwo/fast-cma-es/blob/master/_fcmaescpp/crfmnes.cpp[C++]. Both implementations provide parallel function evaluation.

- Wrapper for https://github.com/CyberAgentAILab/cmaes[cmaes] which provides different CMA-ES variants implemented in Python like
separable CMA-ES and CMA-ES with Margin (see https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.13482) which improves support for mixed integer problems. The wrapper additionally supports
parallel function evaluation.
 
- GCL-DE: Eigen based implementation in https://github.com/dietmarwo/fast-cma-es/blob/master/_fcmaescpp/gcldeoptimizer.cpp[C++]. See "A case learning-based differential evolution algorithm for global optimization of interplanetary trajectory design, Mingcheng Zuo, Guangming Dai, Lei Peng, Maocai Wang, Zhengquan Liu", https://doi.org/10.1016/j.asoc.2020.106451[doi].

- Dual Annealing: Eigen based implementation in https://github.com/dietmarwo/fast-cma-es/blob/master/_fcmaescpp/daoptimizer.cpp[C++]. Use the https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.optimize.dual_annealing.html[scipy implementation] if you prefer a pure python variant or need more configuration options. 

- Expressions: There are two operators for constructing expressions over optimization algorithms: Sequence and random choice.
Not only the five single objective algorithms above, but also scipy and NLopt optimization methods and custom algorithms can be used for defining algorithm expressions. 
 
=== Installation

==== Linux
 
* `pip install fcmaes`. 

To use the {cpp} optimizers a gcc-9.3 (or newer) runtime is required. This is the default on newer Linux versions. 
If you are on an old Linux distribution you need to install gcc-9 or a newer 
version. On ubuntu this is: 

- sudo add-apt-repository ppa:ubuntu-toolchain-r/test
- sudo apt update
- sudo apt install gcc-9

If you have a new anaconda version installed, the required gcc runtime libraries should already be there. 

==== Windows

* `pip install fcmaes`

* install {cpp} runtime libraries https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/2977003/the-latest-supported-visual-c-downloads

* install https://docs.epics-controls.org/projects/how-tos/en/latest/getting-started/installation-windows-msys2.html[MSYS2] using mingw-64:

- download and install the MSYS2 installer https://www.msys2.org/ . 
- start a MSYS2 shell then execute:
- pacman -S mingw-w64-ucrt-x86_64-cmake
- pacman -S mingw-w64-ucrt-x86_64-gcc
- pacman -S mingw-w64-ucrt-x86_64-ninja
- pacman -S mingw-w64-ucrt-x86_64-jemalloc
- pacman -S mingw-w64-ucrt-x86_64-python
- pacman -S mingw-w64-ucrt-x86_64-python-pip
- pacman -S mingw-w64-ucrt-x86_64-python-scipy
- pacman -S mingw-w64-ucrt-x86_64-python-matplotlib
- pacman -S mingw-w64-ucrt-x86_64-python-numba

Make sure that the MSYS2 mingw-w64 ucrt binary path is set in your environment. 
If you have anaconda or other mingw versions installed, make sure there is no path priority issue. 
For fcmaes it is better to use the MSYS2 python installation. 

Parallel fitness function evaluation works only with the native Python optimizers, not with the {cpp} ones. Use "workers = 1" for the 
{cpp}-optimizers. Python multiprocessing is currently generally flawed on Windows. 
To get optimal scaling from parallel retry and parallel function evaluation use:

* Linux subsystem for Windows https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/[WSL].

The Linux subsystem can read/write NTFS, so you can do your development on a NTFS partition. Just the Python call is routed to Linux. 
If performance of the fitness function is an issue and you don't want to use the Linux subsystem for Windows, 
think about using the fcmaes java port: https://github.com/dietmarwo/fcmaes-java[fcmaes-java]. 

==== MacOS

* `pip install fcmaes`

=== Usage

Usage is similar to https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.optimize.minimize.html[scipy.optimize.minimize].

For parallel retry use:

[source,python]
----
from fcmaes.optimizer import logger
from fcmaes import retry
ret = retry.minimize(fun, bounds, logger=logger())
----

The retry logs mean and standard deviation of the results, so it can be used to test and compare optimization algorithms:
You may choose different algorithms for the retry:

[source,python]
----
from fcmaes.optimizer import logger, Bite_cpp, De_cpp, Cma_cpp, Sequence
ret = retry.minimize(fun, bounds, logger=logger(), optimizer=Bite_cpp(100000))
ret = retry.minimize(fun, bounds, logger=logger(), optimizer=De_cpp(100000))
ret = retry.minimize(fun, bounds, logger=logger(), optimizer=Cma_cpp(100000))
ret = retry.minimize(fun, bounds, logger=logger(), optimizer=Sequence([De_cpp(50000), Cma_cpp(50000)]))
----
