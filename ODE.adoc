== Optimize with differential equations

This tutorial discusses the example: https://github.com/dietmarwo/fast-cma-es/blob/master/examples/f8.py[f8.py], an implementation of the F-8 aircraft control problem from https://mintoc.de/index.php/F-8_aircraft[F-8_aircraft] which aims at controlling an aircraft in a time-optimal way from an initial state to a terminal state.

It provides the information you need for your own optimization projects involving differential equations in the
context of parallel retries. The example is described in detail in 
http://www.midaco-solver.com/data/pub/The_Oracle_Penalty_Method.pdf[Oracle Penalty]: In 8 hours on a PC
with 2 GHz clock rate and 2 GB RAM working memory - back in 2010 - the equality constraints could not 
completely be solved using the oracle penalty method. We will use a fixed penalty weight instead, lets see
if 10 years later modern multi-core processors make a difference. 

=== How to implement differential equations in Python

Integrating differential equations inside the objective function is costly. We should do everything we can
to speed things up. Scipy provides two interfaces https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.integrate.ode.html[ode] and https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.integrate.solve_ivp.html[solve_ivp]. There is a massive overhead when using 
`solve_ivp`, see https://github.com/scipy/scipy/issues/8257[Issue 8257] and its interface doesn't fit 
very well with our needs, so we will use the older https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.integrate.ode.html[ode]. Using https://github.com/neurophysik/jitcode[jitcode] we can define
our differential equations in Python but use a precompiled much faster version which is compatible with 
scipys `ode`, see https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.5019320[JiTCODE]. You need to install 
`jitcode` before executing  https://github.com/dietmarwo/fast-cma-es/blob/master/examples/f8.py[f8.py] (`pip install jitcode`). 

[source,python]
----
def get_compiled_function(f, control_pars):
    dummy = jitcode(f, verbose=False, control_pars = control_pars)
    dummy.compile_C()
    return dummy.f
----

The `dummy = jitcode(f,...` call above creates a wrapper for scipy integrators which is used
in all https://github.com/neurophysik/jitcode/tree/master/examples[jitcode examples]. Unfortunately it cannot be used in the context of parallel optimization retry. We would have to copy this wrapper to all processes. Instead
we just extract the compiled differential equations `dummy.f` and use the original https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.integrate.ode.html[ode] interface with these. `ode` can be created separately in each process, since it doesn't involve a costly compilation operation. 

Unbound variables inside the differential equations have to be declared as follows:

[source,python]
----
w = Symbol("w") 
----

and later be set for each integration call:

[source,python]
----
I.set_f_params(w)
y = I.integrate(t)
----

Note that there is another `jitcode` argument `helpers` for common subexpressions which could speed up things further. See for example https://github.com/neurophysik/jitcode/blob/master/examples/SW_of_Roesslers.py[SW_of_Roesslers.py]. 

=== Results for the F-18 problem 

Executing the coordinated retry with pure CMA-ES with `popsize=13`

[source,python]
----
dim = 6
# coordinated retry with CMA-ES optimizer with reduced popsize
ret = advretry.minimize(obj_f, bounds(dim), logger=logger(), optimizer=Cma_cpp(2000, popsize=13))
----

results in:

----
val = 3.78089529 penalty = 0.00000000 f(xmin) = 0.37809
8.81 44272 253 390040 0.378091 2817684.83 96 3 [0.38, ...
val = 3.78085609 penalty = 0.00000000 f(xmin) = 0.37809
44.85 54287 659 2434774 0.378086 2818185.04 172 7 [0.38, ...

solution = [1.1348985292609977, 0.34693726064109887, 1.417784557605076, 1.4994255498647044e-09, 0.1896150683616807, 0.6916206757374317]

After 9 seconds on a 16 core AMD 3950x we find an almost perfect solution, after 45s a solution at least as
good as the best known is found. 

But what about the default settings? 

[source,python]
----
	dim = 6
	# coordinated retry with default optimizer
	ret = advretry.minimize(obj_f, bounds(dim), logger=logger()) 
----    

Now after 9 seconds we get:

----
val = 3.78122898 penalty = 0.00003388 f(xmin) = 0.37816
9.37 63775 259 597579 0.378157 0.63 94 3 [0.38, ... 

val = 3.78085579 penalty = 0.00000000 f(xmin) = 0.37809
48.08 66513 645 3197954 0.378086 0.63 143 7 [0.38,

solution = [1.1348372252390804, 0.3458563912111454, 2.1045379783313223e-07, 0.0007604051033051543, 1.6080218689971524, 0.6913796811453801]
----

after 48 seconds we still find a "perfect" solution - a completely different one. 
But it took longer for the equality constraint error to disappear. So why do we have 
a `DE-CMA` sequence as default? We see it when we try to increase the dimension of 
the problem by adding more https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bang%E2%80%93bang_control[bang bang] switches.
Even with `dim = 30` the coordinated retry with pure CMA-ES fails. But lets try a real challenge:
`dim = 50`. Note that the upper bound `2.0` for each phase now leads the optimization initially to much higher values, an overall `time = 100` is now valid.  

[source,python]
----
	dim = 50
	# coordinated retry with default optimizer
	ret = advretry.minimize(obj_f, bounds(dim), logger=logger()) 
----    

On an AMD 3950X 16 core machine we get:

----

About 5000 seconds to reduce the constraint violation down to `0.0001`. And we know that `f(xmin) = 0.37809`
is possible since 50 switches can "emulate" 6 switches by setting 44 variables to `0`.
Of course the original `dim = 6` already had no strong "real world" relation since using only 4 switches produces good results. But the maximal dimension / number of switches an optimizer can handle is a nice performance indicator. May be there is an algorithm able to handle `dim = 100` ?. Or can reduce the constraint violation faster than fcmaes with `dim = 50`?

Lets repeat the same experiment on an AMD 2990WX 32 core machine. This old Zen 1 based processor has memory latencies causing inferior scaling compared with the new AMD 3970x, but optimization uses not much memory and therefore scales excellently:

Now we have `27565` function evaluations per second compared to `16749` on the 3950x. I havent't seen any other application scaling this well on the 2990WX. After 20445 seconds we found a nearly perfect solution even with 50 bang bang switches.
