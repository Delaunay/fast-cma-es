== Solving Mixed Integer Problems

What if some of the variables of our optimization problem are restricted to be integers
(see https://github.com/dietmarwo/fast-cma-es/blob/master/examples/gear_train.py[gear_train.py]) - or
are integer multiples of some real value (see https://github.com/dietmarwo/fast-cma-es/blob/master/examples/vessel.py[vessel.py])?

We could define all variables as continuous and map these to the nearest feasible value as done in both examples above. The vessel example has shown, that we have to be careful when using an optimizer
which utilizes derivatives - since this mapping destroys the smoothness of the objective function. 
But luck is on our side, all fcmaes optimizers are derivative-free. So we don't expect 
problems here. To verify this assumption, lets analyze a non-trivial example:

Here http://www.midaco-solver.com/index.php/about/benchmarks/gtopx[Midaco/GTOPX] we find 
the example Cassini1-MINLP. As the name indicates, this is not a linear programming problem, 
the objective function is not linear. MILP (Mixed Integer Linear Programming) problems with linear
objective functions are easy to solve and require different algorithms to maximize efficiency. 

It is recommended to read http://www.midaco-solver.com/data/pub/CEC2019_Schlueter_Munetomo.pdf[CEC2019]
first, it contains a detailed description of the problem:

We have mentioned the https://www.esa.int/gsp/ACT/projects/gtop/cassini1/[Cassini] problem already in 
https://github.com/dietmarwo/fast-cma-es/blob/master/Results.adoc[Results] and https://github.com/dietmarwo/fast-cma-es/blob/master/PYKEP.adoc[Pykep gym results], Cassini1-MINLP is an extension of this benchmark. The original https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/missions/cassini/overview/[Cassini Mission]
to Saturn involved four gravity-assists at Venus, Venus, Earth and Jupiter to save fuel. 

Cassini1-MINLP now adds four variables performing the decision which planets to use for the four flybys. Nasa/JPL has shown limited "intuition" choosing a planet sequence for the https://sophia.estec.esa.int/gtoc_portal/?page_id=13[GTOC1 competition] as we have seen in the last section of https://github.com/dietmarwo/fast-cma-es/blob/master/Tutorial.adoc[Tutorial]. Better tools could assist "intuition" and could simplify mission planning. 

The authors of http://www.midaco-solver.com/data/pub/CEC2019_Schlueter_Munetomo.pdf[CEC2019] are right: If we find a better planet sequence for Cassini this could be caused by flaws in the model. Allowing deep space maneuvers between planets as in https://www.esa.int/gsp/ACT/projects/gtop/cassini2/[Cassini2] could help. Additionally the final flyby at Jupiter probably was required because it is of significant scientific value. This topic will be analyzed further in the last section.   

==== Cassini1-MINLP

image::cassini.png[]

From http://www.midaco-solver.com/data/pub/CEC2019_Schlueter_Munetomo.pdf[CEC2019] : 
"The general MINLP formulation of Cassini1 remains yet intractable
and therefore appears to be even more difficult
than the hardest continuous instance from the entire
GTOP database, which is the Messenger (full version) benchmark. The difficulty of this particular MINLP
instance appears to arise from a very decisive local
optimum, which prevents the optimization algorithm
from reaching the global optimal integer sequence"

So we expect a real challenge.

To ensure comparability of the results we use the same Cassini1-MINLP code from http://www.midaco-solver.com/data/gtopx/cpp/gtopx.cpp . We copied also the original bounds to 
https://github.com/dietmarwo/fast-cma-es/blob/master/fcmaes/astro.py[astro.py]:

----
	lb = [-1000.,30.,100.,30.,400.,1000., 1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0 ],
	ub = [0.,400.,470.,400.,2000.,6000., 9.0,9.0,9.0,9.0 ]       
----
Usually we recommend to assign the same continuous interval to each discrete value. As defined here, since the mapping is done using the `round` operation, Mercury and Pluto only get a 0.5-wide interval, all other planets have a 1.0-wide one.

==== Intractability

How did http://www.midaco-solver.com/data/pub/CEC2019_Schlueter_Munetomo.pdf[CEC2019]  
conclude that Cassini1-MINLP is "intractable"? They first identified the individual
best global optimal solutions corresponding to different planet
sequences, of which there are 9^4 = 6561 possible combinations. Then they checked if the best
combination is found by their Ant Colony Optimization based MINLP solver. 

The problem with that approach is: What if the test of the 6561 possible combinations was already flawed? The original Cassini1 problem is easy to solve, so they expected the same for all combinations. We will soon see whether this assumption was justified. They found the sequence Earth, Venus, Earth, Jupiter with deltaV = 3.507 to be optimal which is superior to the original sequence Venus, Venus, Earth, Jupiter
with deltaV = 4.9307. 

==== Applying the coordinated retry

Lets apply fcmaes coordinated retry using the default optimizer `de_cma` (see https://github.com/dietmarwo/fast-cma-es/blob/master/examples/cassini_minlp.py[cassini_minlp.py]):

[source,python]
----
from fcmaes.astro import Cassini1minlp
from fcmaes.optimizer import logger
from fcmaes.advretry import minimize

def _test_optimizer(problem, num_retries = 100000, num = 100, value_limit = 100.0, log = logger()):
    log.info(problem.name + ' ' + opt.name)
    for i in range(num):
        ret = minimize(problem.fun, problem.bounds, value_limit, num_retries, log)

_test_optimizer(Cassini1minlp()) 
----

We set `num_retries = 100000` because we expect the problem to be hard to solve. 
We execute the code on an AMD 3950x 16 core processor at 4.0GHZ. The results are surprising:

image::minlp.png[]

After about 10 sec fcmaes coordinated retry surpasses the old "reference" solution at deltaV = 3.507. We 
observe strong "resistance" at deltaV = 2.896, but after about 1000 sec this value is also
improved significantly in many runs. The best solution at deltaV = 2.17576 is reached only once out of 20 runs.

----

We conclude:

- Cassini1-MINLP is indeed currently intractable for Ant Colony Optimization based algorithms.
- We have no clue if it is also intractable for fcmaes coordinated retry, since we have nothing to compare to. 
- The "test of the 6561 possible combinations" was indeed flawed, it was not able to find the superior planet sequences from the seven solutions above.

==== Fixing the objective function

As already mentioned in https://github.com/dietmarwo/fast-cma-es/blob/master/PYKEP.adoc[Pykep gym results] there is a fundamental flaw both in the https://www.esa.int/gsp/ACT/projects/gtop/[GTOP] problems as also in their newer replacements https://github.com/esa/pykep/tree/master/pykep/trajopt/gym[reference problems]:

Restricting the coasting trajectory legs to single revolution transfers has a number of nasty side effects, specially for the inner planets:

- Global optima are much better "shielded" since for long transfer times it is very unlikely to find a low deltaV single revolution transfer
- Many good solutions involving multi revolution coasting legs are invalid. 

This flaw artificially makes the GTOP problems harder to solve. This is not a "real world" issue, since in the real world there is no reason for the "single revolution" restriction. 

Although we don't know which planet sequence is best, we can at least narrow the parameter space. 
Heading to any planet outer than Earth for the first three flybys makes no sense, it would slow down the trajectory too much. With the same arguments the fourth encounter can be limited to Jupiter or some planet nearer to the sun as Jupiter. Which leads to the following limits with equal continuous intervals associated with each valid planet: 

----
	lb = [-1000.,30.,100.,30.,400.,1000., 0.51,0.51,0.51,2.51 ],
	ub = [0.,400.,470.,400.,2000.,6000., 3.49,3.49,3.49,5.49 ]       
----

After implementing a fix for GTOP using the new PYKEP Lambert solver we repeat the experiment using the restricted bounds excluding the outer planets.

image::minlp2.png[]

We observe much "smoother" curves which means there are many more good solutions. And the best one with `deltaV = 1.846`
using planet sequence "Earth, Venus, Venus, Earth" is found in all ten runs after about 100 - 600 sec. 

==== Why did they use VVEJ for the real Cassini mission?

The question why the sequence Venus, Venus, Earth, Jupiter was chosen for the real Cassini mission can easily be answered by checking the alternative planet sequences we found using the much more accurate model from 
https://github.com/esa/pykep/blob/master/pykep/trajopt/gym/_cassini2.py[pykep cassini2]. In https://github.com/dietmarwo/fast-cma-es/blob/master/PYKEP.adoc[Pykep gym results] we find a visualisation of a good solution for the original planet sequence with deltaV = 0.729 km/s. A quick 5 min check for the other sequences shows:

- VVEJ: deltaV = 0.729 km/s
- EVEJ: deltaV = 2.434 km/s
- EEVE: deltaV = 2.606 km/s
- EVVE: deltaV = 3.534 km/s
- EMMJ: deltaV = 9.571 km/s

Using deep space maneuvers and a generally more accurate model of the real mission shows that VVEJ needs only a fraction of the deltaV compared to the other planet sequences. The GTOP Cassini1 benchmark has only a very limited relevance in the real world.
